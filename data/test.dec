I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Tons
Then that's all you had to say.
No...
They do not!
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Like you care.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
You set me up.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Perm?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
Daddy, no!
Why?
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
So they tell me...
Thirty-two.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
You wanna go out with him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
Block E?
An attempted slit.
That's never been proven
Does it matter?
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
My mission in life.
Oh, right.  Friday.
You -- covered in my vomit.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
You know what they say
What?
Maybe.
Do what?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
I'm gettin' there
What are you doing here?
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Hearsay.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
Why not?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
What?
Enough!
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
When I go?
Hi.
What?
Just for now.
I'm likin' you guys better
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
What's to discuss?
Pirate -- no question.
Dr. Ruth?
But -- who -- what --?
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
We'll all go crazy...
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
The Judgment is ours!
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
I know.
Thank God...
This time with me!
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
I'm not bargaining!
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief says...
He understands.
So was Christ!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Colon!  Don't!
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
You are bound by an oath, Father.
Give me absolution.
I knew you would.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We don't need to know.
God be with us admiral.
Come over here.
Six days ago, yes.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
What else do you need?
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
They won't until this is over.
Somewhere else?
So...the station is empty?
They're not gonna send you right back.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
Right.
Who do you think, Chief?!
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
Stay with her.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Describe him.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
You're Polish?
Stay here.
I'm on duty.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
My point exactly.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
I'm not.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Could be Leon's.
Well, that's great.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
See you later.  Good luck.
Don't be late.
Not what.  Who.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
You stuff sausage in it.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
You'll be my first.
Get down on your knees.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Yes.
Okay.
Don't speak Russian!
You said speak Czech!
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Shut up.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Credit?
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
Surprise!  Surprise!
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
What are you coming here to do?
No way!  He's mine!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
I used an accelerant.
Oh yeah, why?
Aren't you tired?
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Sure, what is it?
It's possible.
Are you reasonably awake?
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Yes.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
He's got a point.
What is it, Hal?
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Did they have any explanation for this?
How many days until you come home?
Thank you, Daddy.
Yes, Daddy.
Thank you.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Well, that does sound very odd.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Fine.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Certainly.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
I will if I can, Frank.
True.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Great, just great.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
I got a lot to protect.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
How much?
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
So you took the rest of the night off...
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
You sure that's the reason?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Partnership?
There's nothin' to talk about.
Jack?
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
When? How?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
That's the way I see it, too.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Hi, it's me...
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
That's what I always say.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Yeah, old times.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
First, the money.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Five bills.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Napoleon... small.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
You know exactly where they are!
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
They are robots!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
I brought the girl remember?
She's an exception..
And then?
What is?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
How many points you got left on your license?
So, just how big was this fare?
...'Scuse me?
...Leeloo.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
This is a police control action..
Uh... not really.
I don't think this is a good time...
Yeah, very big, a giant.
What mission?
Why not?
I thought you were divorced.
Uh..you're welcome.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Learning language.
All 900.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I told you not to read all that crap!
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Wonderful!
...What do you mean?
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Why the gun?
... What's going on?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
I just talked to her.
What you see is what I got, mister.
I'm telling you...
Hmm.
And they are?
I'd rather you didn't.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
You betrayed us.
Any good?
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
What do you want?
I told you, I don't know.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Why?
Stop talking.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
They're no friends of mine.
Yeah... guess so.
Pardon me?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
I'll risk it.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Good for you.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Interesting theory.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
It's their Presidential Suite.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
I try to be.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
I'm afraid I don't...
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
I hope it's nothing serious.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
I don't understand, who are... ?
Neil... Neil Cole.
No.
We're all like that.
What?
Yes.
It's been six years.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
No... no... no...
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
No, you may not.
I don't want to.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
We have matching luggage.
You're his sister, right?
Three days.
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
It's okay, we're just about there.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
She knew she was gonna die.
Oh God!  He killed them!
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
He's inside you, where he hides.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
I've got to go.
No, the Dan part was nice...
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
Krueger is reality.
That's the only reason you're alive...
If they actually bothered to bury her.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
I don't know!
That's their problem.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
But I've seen her grave.
No shit.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
I want to talk about the baby.
He invited me to his house last night.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
So they caught up with you, too?
I guess.
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
Listen!  Hear that?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Something wrong?
Thirty-four seconds!
We can <u>ram</u> him!
Your friend was to remain where he was!
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
I'll be another!
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Yeah. I know about that.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
You can't buy Wade off.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Really.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
How'd you get the job?
In the chest.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Lawford?
What are you talking about?
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Nothing.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
I figured you already heard.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
I'm fine, fine.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Where's Jill?
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Mel Gordon.
But not now.
You knew me as a kid.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Wade.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
There's a furnace.
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
His office. You mean my old office.
Atta-go.
Nothing.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Huh?
What happened?
What about her?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Your father never means to be so...
Some kids were teasing you?
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Did we warn them off?
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Yes, Mr. President.
Ga get it.
Dead.
We're not going to make it.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Tower, here.
A dubious distinction, no?
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Come on, Alice.
I know he left you behind.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
No.
You'll do it?
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
They've gotta be joking.
Yes, sir.
That isn't necessary.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
But...
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
Commissioner.
I just wish it was that simple.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Dunn.
Accelerators down.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Who's that, Ted?
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
If that's the way you want it.
Let me by, Elaine.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
What word would you use, Elaine?
Ted, please be careful.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Compute!
Simon.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
I'm so excited, Simon.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Sure.
Yeah.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
I don't want to live anymore.
You're sure?
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Sixteen 'C', why?
What should I say?
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Then Elaine was right.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Hello.
Who wants to be first?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Yes, Captain?
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
I will, but Jim won't.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Of course.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Yeah...
That's right.
Show me.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
And that fits?
And still it fits?
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
At the end of the bar.
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
This is mole.  It's good.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
When will Strader return?
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
To the... to the beach?
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
You look very good.
Only holds five.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
Sure.  Just a minute.
Yeah.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
It is. 
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Hear me out...
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
Sorry to disappoint you.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Sir?
Aye-firmative.
Poor bastard.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
Fuck you.
Hudson, give us a break.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Seal the door.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Terrible.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Why not?
You're really something, ace.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Where is she?
You mean dead.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
Certainly!
His Grace is very angry with you.
I'm so relieved.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
I want to go!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
What?
Of course.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
You borrowed money from your mother?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Tell them to go!
I love you! I love you!
What does she want?
Stanzi!
Your father is dead.
Why not? Half the house!
I'm not telling you.
You'd think I was mad.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Oh, thank you, sir!
What for?
What do you mean?
He asked me to stay.
Not at all.
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
Oh, yes.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Adorable!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Gertrude!
Yes. He is a little strange.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
And the result satisfies.
Of course not.
Yes?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
What? On one hearing only?
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Well. There it is.
Am I not welcome?
Is she not here?
Don't you have a maid?
Yes.
How many?
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
This is just a game, Papa.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Papa!
Bene.
Really? What is it he's writing?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
German!
Why not?
Madame.
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
But this is absurd!
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Whom did they choose?
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
I never knew that music like that was possible.
How much?
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
We ended in F Major?
What time?
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
I'm not leaving you.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
I regret it is not too familiar.
Do you believe it?
I poisoned his life.
What difference does that make?
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Exactly.
Yes.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Did we?
I can't wait.
What do you mean - now?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Yes, I believe he did.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Has his friend appeared to him again?
What did he say?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
Is David acting strangely?
I beg your pardon?
Yes?
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Right.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
Will you come with me?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
Now I'm embarrassed.
A werewolf?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
I would think so.
There is only one bed.
Do me an enormous favor?
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
A doper werewolf.
Don't you remember?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
No.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
You did, did you?
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
No, but we're about to.
That's very funny, that is.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David.
She's a jerk.
Nice to see you.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
I don't know. Come on.
Yeah.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Nurse!
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
Yes.
What do you think?
What about the zoo?
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
What about?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
What is?
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
What are you doing here?
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
Hello, darling.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Yes.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Well . . .
Happy now?
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Now don't you worry about it.
Yes, sir.
Yes, thank you.
Yes, sir.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
But I haven't . . .
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
What are you talking about?
Did you get the case for the securities?
What'll we do?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Oh, is that so?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Yes, why?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Okay, Matt.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
What have you done?
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
He's not bad at it.
Nope.
Oh no...
Tomorrow.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Exactly.
Hey!
He's been full of vinegar lately.
What?
I think I recognize you.
You're not scared, are you?
She got two of them.
Sorry.
Yep.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Pass me some whisky.
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Both would be nice.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Strategically.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
The District Marshall
Ho-yah!
What is it?
Died a hero.
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
So we got a plan?
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
I reckoned.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Bob's upset.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
They're making him a hero now.
A fair number, Ma.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Yes ma'am.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Thank you.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I guess so.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
I think so.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
They had to be dealt with!
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Yes sir.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
THEN WHO DID?!
What is going on here, man?
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
What, sir?
I remember you.
I demand action.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Turn the light on.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Oh God, just get it over with.
Alright.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Everybody's rich.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
Yes, I am.
How did you guess?
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
No.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
There was no ad in the Times.
What exactly do you mean?
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
It's just not.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Patrick?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Like what?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Oh really? That's great.
When?
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Patrick?
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
No, not really.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
What's that?
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
That's...that's too bad.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Who do you ask?
What do you mean...Yale thing?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
People just...disappear.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
And?
Marcus?
Where was Marcus?
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
I'm hungry.
It's...it's...all right.
Oh well, you know.
Yeah, well, you're late.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
Didn't you visit the campus?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
Milo. Why would he --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Just shut up?
Great.
It's gonna get cold.
No.
I am. I am, sir.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Is it your dish?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Would you like a Coke or something?
I do!
What're you implying.
Talk about work? Never!
Oh. Yeah.
'Have a look?
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
'Sorry about the late notice...
Wait... He knows.
You do?
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Got out of my other commitment.
Keep looking.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
You know my name.
You're famous around here.
She saved my life.
Why would you do a thing like --
The Day Care?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
What'd he say?
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
But you said the other --
What?
What?!
I don't know.
What does that mean?
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Groovy.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Smashing!
We know all that, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Thanks.
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Be careful.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Yes, Basil?
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
I'm sorry?
Sure.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Shut up.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Here, have a piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
What are you saying, son?
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
No, he's really evil.
... head ...
... love...
... love ...
... love ...
So I'm still ...
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
To find out who killed my husband.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
Too many cooks --
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Ring?
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
Whereas you are.
And just what is the game?
Mother?
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Very good, Steed ...
Is that written in his shoe?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
You don't trust me?
You lied.
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Have a look at this.
Where are you going?
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
You're saying I have no choice.
Decontamination -- ?
Surveillance? By whom?
Getting to what?
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Guilty until proven innocent?
I think so, thank you so much ...
I feel sure of it.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
I was at Harrow ...
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
I'm very happy for you two.
Fan out and look for them.
Yes I did.
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir, I am.
I've tried to change her mind.
But a fabulous cook.
I can't sleep.
About what?
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Yeah.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
That's more like it.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
All right, who serves?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
Olivier's in that, right?
My gift to you.
So long, Father.
Oooooo.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
I'm saved. Let's party!
You got it.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
I don't know.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
We're gonna be okay, man...
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
What, you've never seen one before?
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Hey! You don't know me --
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
-- Never mind.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
C'mon, let's crawl home.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Roll the hose.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
How's it going?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
-- I work for the city.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
That's a dumb thing to say.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
What?
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
The outlets.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
What?
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
Fire.
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Four months.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Backdraft.
I was ahead of my time.
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Fixing my roof.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
Putty? On both doors?
You like everybody, Ronald.
I know you.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Investigator Rimgale.
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
Why?
Yeah.
You mean you could use it.
"The Strawberries"?
Yes.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
I forgive you.
All right, cop. I want my money.
All right. What are you gonna do?
How about 7 1/2?
Are you sure?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Ho!
Please.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Must be the pressure.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
How much?
Different.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Mantan!!
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I'm wid it.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
I don't know about that plantation angle.
We think so.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I want to speak with you.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Where do you go from here?
Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Manray!
This is Cheeba.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
Break a leg.
I thought it was appropiate.
He's just playing big brother.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
He said that?
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
The best defense is offense.
You've never had any formal training, either?
What do you mean?
Tavis, thank you for having me.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...I heard different, thought that was...
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
A song a comin' I feel.
No, before my time.
You look beautiful like that.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Just ask me what you want to know.
I never was more in earnest.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
And so I am.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
Your cousins go out with him.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Only the agency of servants.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
It is my only object.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
As much as possible.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Good night, my little darling.
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
And he doesn't care about me?
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
We found him like this --
We don't know. West is dead.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
Tell me about them.
You wanna bet?
Epilepsy.
Would you have believed me?
Can't do that now, though, can you?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
I...
West's. Any kindling for afire?
You're the only one missing a grenade.
If not you, then who?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Put it down!
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
But you didn't.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Because I was standing next to him.
I don't know --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
I'm not gonna let that happen.
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
The Senator...
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Yes.
Why?
Excuse me?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
I lost a bet.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
The very same.
I plan to grow on you.
So noted.
Got it.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
I lied. Wait for it...
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Isn't this how your story goes?
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
He whispered it in my ear.
We've been making progress, I see.
Fifty minutes.
You can't threaten me --
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
Sir, yes, sir!
That's great.
Yes!
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Edward Bloom.
No one's ever left.
Fine, I will.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
Eighteen.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Stop.
Can I take your picture?
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
You were talking about your wedding.
Beats me.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
You think I'm up for it?
So how does it happen?
Okay.
Can we talk?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You think I'm fake.
How what happens?
Go out with me.
I'm robbing this place.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
Because he's dying.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
Yes.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
Probably tonight.
Did you?
But it's not true.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
We rented a car.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
We'll stop then.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Uh... Yes.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
I'm asking what you're here for.
Oh.  We are Russian.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
What?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
John.
He wants money.
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
You don't understand anything.
What?
I said I don't have any.
I don't want to talk about him.
So now you hate all women?
You...
You don't understand you either.
Thank Christ for that.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
No. I think I better just go.
Okay. Promise?
Tell me about it.
Thanks.
Just wanted to see.
You hurt it?
Yes?
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
I need ya help again.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
You gonna miss your bus.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
I got others.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Yeah.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
LAZ, I said let...!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Anything.
I'm here with you.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
What I love.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Word wit'cha. In private.
Huh?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Naw!
Don't know if God wanna see me.
Or what?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Please don't tell my daddy.
You could put it that way.
What's on your mind?
Yeah, I do.
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
All that shit's on aisle 5.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
The hell you call me?
Home.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Charlie...
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Let's grab some food.
You said that in the last two places.
I hope not.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
What does Charlie mean?
Connie...
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
You can trust me.
Shut-up.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
What...?  Why?
Kampai.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
I couldn't tell.
There was a change in plans.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
Who am I supposed to be?
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
I'm taking you back.
Then take it from him.
Yeah.
What...?  What if I say no?
Why me?
The families who control the casinos?
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
You want him dead too.
If he won't cooperate?
Death.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Well, actually
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
When do you deliver your project?
He's not ready yet.
Tomorrow, he says.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
Sorry, don't have the time.
Prosit.
I don't know.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
These aren't just...
Huh huh.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Too old.
What did she want?
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
You mean the snake.
Does it eat?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I work alone.
So?
You did?
Like?
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
I never felt better.
What's a long time?
Because it's not.
What?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Black?
Sorry.
I'm tired of this.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
They left.
You scared me.
Is that why you're still here?
Yes?
You like it?
Thank-Q!
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Oh, brother...
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
No, you get out of here.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
I just had a mental picture of...
Get away from me!!
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
No.
What's the pay?
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Name it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
I like it.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Wow.
Uh...yeah.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Okay!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Not that one!
And don't be so obvious!
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Is that what you call it?
Sing it to me.
Yes, it is.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
Why?
Blow out the candles!
Shit is a French word?
Yes, father?! Yes?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
I'm not wearing his pants.
So, did you buy a movie?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
My father is a genius.
How do you do, ma'am.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Sorry, Mom!
I'll go up.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Are you in trouble, son?!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
Yeah.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
I never know anymore.
Yes, dear!
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Then after that it's safe.
No.
All our friends...
I'm not hungry.
How could you?! This is just like home!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
What?
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Coming!
Well, we did in my family!
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
No.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
Excuse me.
I thought ten years.
Well, that's blunt!
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Uh..he might of.
Those sluts!
To bed.
Uh, yes, you do.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
Fallout shelter.
We'll find him.
Then what?
What?!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Yes.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
It must be great.
The criminals are winning.
Yeah.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Jeffrey.
Nothing. Are you alright?
No, please. I won't.
Do you know?
You don't?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
No.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Hello.
I'm doing it.
Yes.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
No, it's not Don.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
No.  Hi baby.
Alright, suit yourself.
My bourbon.
You want to see him too, right?
Those are my breasts.
If you want to.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Here's to Ben.
Nothing.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Alright.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Uh-uh.
Am I bothering you?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Where are they?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
He got a little jealous.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
No.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Go ahead!
Stop it Mike.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Where's your gun?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
I-I'll tip her.
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
Connor, is that you?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Fuck!
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
He got beat up by a girl.
Italian.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
Just like on TV.
Yes, we are.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
You... oh god, why?
Really want to know?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
What about one guy with two guns?
What?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Sweet-n-low!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Shit! Shit!
We promise.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
I'll be back at 9:00.
Hey, Murph.
Y'know it is, a bit.
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Yes.
What do you want me to say?
Yeah boss?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Dignan, it's --
No. This is he.
Would they do that?
She's an attractive older woman.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Just turn right here.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Don't even say it, man.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Because my mom gets the bill.
I don't want to use it.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Bob?
It's not a plan. It's just --
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
On the left.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Where was it parked?
This morning.
If you say so.
OK.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I don't think we can do that.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Who's Mr. Henry?
Let me feel that.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Roger.
Any activity?
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
It's going back down.
Nobody move!
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Come on, Kumar.
I'll get him.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Oh, I'd say about --
Dignan, I --
Scale the --
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Hold it.
Take a deep breath.
I don't want to die.
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Sixty days?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
God, yes. Like silk.
I hear you're a good thief.
Uh-uh.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
I don't know about that.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Not even for emergencies?
That never would of --
I'll just drive my car.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Good question.
I can't believe you said that.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
God DAMMIT.
He electrocuted someone?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
No. I was calm.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
See you in a little while.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
I can't do that, Bob.
What is it?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Stand by. Bird Dog?
He's having a heart attack or something.
Where's Applejack?
He said what?
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Where's that guy going?
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Fight. You know.
What?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
There was a mistake.
One last push. One.
Bourne comes here? Why?
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
The sooner the better.
It was staged?
Lots of people...
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
I speak English.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
What?
You killed them.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Felt a little light.
Sorry. Old habits.
Conklin.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
I don't know.
I don't know who that is.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
What?
-- not yet --
Yes.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
What is this, a game?
I killed him???
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
I want someone I know to take me in.
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Careful...
Sounds like a threat.
Who's going? Us?
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
That's where we came out.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Am I a doctor, no, but...
And why is that?
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
So?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
And what about you, anything?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
It was in Latin, sir.
We must sue for peace.
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
I have ordered conscriptions...
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
Wallace's followers.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
I will not.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Nor I!
...Tonight!
It's battle I want, not talk.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
They've tricked us.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Sure...
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Yes.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
I thought you were a December baby.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Of course.
It was a long time ago.
I walk differently?
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
What happened?? Where are we?!
What's wrong with you?!
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
You're such a retard!
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
I came with Captain Renault.
No.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Yes, Monsieur.
-- Will he keep his word?
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
What is your name?
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
I won't.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
And the carrying charges?
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
I will.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Here it is.
Yes.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
Yes.
Are you quite finished with us?
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Victor Laszlo?
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Why two?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Huh?
What friend?
Oh, thanks.
Serves me right for not being musical.
Put that gun down.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
What is your nationality?
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Put that phone down!
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
I like it fine here.
No.
No.
Then don't have a drink.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
Worse than Warsaw.
Feels so good to lie here.
You've had today's water.
Going to die anyway.
I'm putting it off.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
Okay.  Sure.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
You don't seem too happy about it.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
You have any children?
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
Not when you have no choice.
It means a lot...that you came.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Yeah.
That new roof, that's your doing.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
What's going on down there?
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
We're on.
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
Hallelujah.
To life.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
You weren't dreaming about me.
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
Better than I can!
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Burma!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Right.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
What do you want me to *do*?
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
Actually, I volunteered.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
Right.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
Right?
Yes, for both.
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
In other words, scurvy.
Nobody's named this one yet.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
No trouble.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
She took off in the night!
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
And you have this letter of intent?
Isn't it always?
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
It's not true.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Jake, I mean, come on --
I told you, use less powder.
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
Two million.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
She's up for it.
We'll use the Euc.
Because you killed one of my crew.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Something stupid.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Sure.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Help me.
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Just play a part. A little acting.
What?
Then show me how.
Uh-huh.
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
Do you have a ticket?
With identification.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
A little bit of both.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
I can handle it.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
Roger that.
No. Thanks.
Goodnight.
Why did you quit?
I despise the job.
What are you talking about?
I don't know anything about it.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
Not entirely.
You mean I won't resist them.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
What about a drink on the way home?
I'm on at nine.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
Never. Why do you ask?
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I want to buy a car.
There's a casino in this hotel.
In the casino.
What kind of trouble?
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
What about my neck?
Wait a minute...
Let it go.
What for?
Yes.
Do you?
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Jack! It's Jani.
Who did it? Tell me!
Turn left at the lights.
How long have you worked at the casino?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Good call. Help yourself.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Don't worry.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
I put them on together.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
I was at Beadles.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
Any exceptions?
They've been tested.
Five.
I said good call.
I don't gamble.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Very impressive.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
What flickering light?
Look, bomb...
Key? Key? What is the key?
The key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Time to start talking.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Right!
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
Yes, Doolittle.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Ah, negative drop.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Not now!
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Ah... pity, pity...
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
Yeah?
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
That's not why we're here.
What the hell are you doing?
None of your business.
No.
Where?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
Police drone.
Don't look down.
I ain't mad at you...
It's a rule.
Am I?
Can you help me get her back?
I don't want to move away.
Girl's gotta make a living.
First time I ever heard that.
Whoever that is.
Yeah...
I won't be staying.
Yes on all counts.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
The other ones?
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
Your help.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
Somebody's got to.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Open it.
We're quoting Mom again.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
I'll wait.
A friend of your fiance's.
You're also a fool.
Let go of my hand.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
You did.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Here's your money.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
What?
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
I have sincere eyes.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Later.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Max--
Exactly.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Lydia.
I'm a toy to her.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
You don't.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Gin.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Yeah, a man's drink...
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Yeah.
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
Check!
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
The easy way.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
It's my Bullworker.
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
I said, I'm sorry!
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Let's lift up her shirt.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You'll know soon enough.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You have to do something for me first.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
Why is that?
I'm sorry.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
What?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
But you're OK?
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Where are we going?
Yeah...
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
That is a terrible nickname.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Where it came from?
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
Yes.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Yes.
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
I... I was playing with fire.
What else makes you feel regret?
I have the power to build a time machine.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
How did you know --
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
She's right over there.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Really, Loretta?
My mom wanted me to have this?
Really?
Okay.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Huh?
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
We all do. Now let's go.
I just did.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Yes...
Yes, Leslie!
I know.
Oh, naw. Hi.
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
All right, they're makin' a movie.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Becky was my only shot at state!
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
Nothin' too showy!
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Okay, everybody, listen up!
We need more bars!
Enid ate a whole pan!
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
The President of the United States.
"My dear"...
But you're my father -
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
You told it to me.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
Sure.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
I still like UPSTART the best.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
The king can do no wrong!
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
I thought everything was working out fine.
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
Two, please.
Oh?
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Do you?
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
What do you mean?
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
Right... Right.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
What a mess.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
y-y-yes--
You're English.
Yes.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Good morning.
Thank you... very much.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
You did not ask me.
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
Yes.
Of course! What did you think?
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
I've heard.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
You're losing your temper!
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
"The fifth one this week"!
And I thought you said it was something special...
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
That's right!
Yes -- I believe you do.
There is something I must ask the Gods...
No... no...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
I see the world.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
I'm sure it's lovely.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
You've got to let me go!
Why?
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Oh, get it over with.
Well... no...
It saved my father!
Very deep... usually...
I know. I know.
I met this girl...
She got me thinking...
Sorry.
Why should WE care?
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
But...
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
We'd be the first!
I have to go...
Bye... sorry...
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
What are you talking about?
Hang on...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
That's right.
Relax!
I must only let the red rage...
Stop it!
Sh!
Helpless...
Just a little overworked, maybe.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Okay, I guess.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Well, I didn't want to assume.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Okay.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
I like to read.
What?
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
That's scary sounding.
I think so.
You'll call me, right?
I want to have a baby.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
No. Thanks.
I'm right here.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
This is our first "date" date.
What was I wearing?
Egad, were you horrified?
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
yeah?
Okay.
Oh.
Female.
I don't know.
That's okay. I --
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
It's too late.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
And what are you like? A wino?
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
You have to stop this!
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
It's not somebody else.
I miss you.
Oh! Great. That's great!
I had a good time last night. I really did.
Nah, I don't know.
Yeah. Cool.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
I better do this, Stan.
How did I look?
Can I... I brought some --
Then why did you ask me?
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Yes?
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
Is that Nietzsche?
He went home sick.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Jesus.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Siwash, huh?
The Clock People?
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
I'm the best.
Tired...
Bonanza Jellybean?
Your ranch?
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
No, he didn't.
It is not.
We'll make it.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Hear what?
What happened?
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
He's crashing...
The dark inside me.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Starck!
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Start the countdown.
Yes, sir!
Justin.
Starck, you still showing those readings?
Alive?
Do it.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
That is not acceptable --
Negative.
It's complicated...
If it worked, yes.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
I don't know.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
What do you want me to say?
Yes...
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
You're lying...!
Starck... Cooper...
Something like that, yeah.
Starck...
Love to.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
What is it, Smith?
Come again, Skipper?
No, no, we just got her back together...
I just finished drying...
Keep your eyes open.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
What's causing the readings?
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
What's going on in there, Starck?
Blow it up?
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
1000 meters...
Picking up magnetic interference.
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
Yes.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Victor must've taken him.
What is this? Where's Reed?
And you can? Power it up?
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Not this again --
What about you?
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Please tell me you go silent too.
Girl...?!
Dude. That's my sister.
Showtime.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Yes, thanks.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
You were?
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Not at all.
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I understand the business reasons.
Susan. What are you doing?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Don't worry about it.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Later.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Where did you hear that?
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
No.
They were left over from the last shift.
Okay, Dennis.
Dad says!
I know what I look like.
Let's continue.
What? Are you all right?
I didn't see you this morning.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
No.
Really.
Fascinating.
That's me, Merv.
Naw. Any good?
All right.
Just be glad you're all right.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
Should we buy a frame for that?
It was nice.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
No.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
What?
That little prick.
What do you want?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
Aloha, Spicoli.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Yes.
Sure thing.
I've heard that, too.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Do you want to come inside?
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Do you really have to go?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
I'd like that.
Yes... It makes sense.
Righto!
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
Naked.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
This is my granddaughter...
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
My heart!
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
GO?
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
How about a check?
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Some of what?
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Never missed a plane yet.
Nobody. I'm the maid!
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
They'll be back.
But it's got teeth.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Where's that?
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
And the rest of 'em?
There's a tunnel.
Just an observation.
Why don't you go check it out?
You weren't helpin'.
Oh yeah?
Well then I guess we should just give up.
My truck.
Anyone else?
We gotta try.
What's in the back?
But not flush against the tunnel?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Well...
But --
Okay then.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
What?
He only shot you once.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Fully.
Covered.
Seven.
No bullshit.
Duh hickey.
What?
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
If he doesn't shut up...
She's not very nice, is she?
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Not without you!!!
GO-GO-GO!!
All right.
Deal.
Um, well...
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Who's this?
You see: We've got to change that name.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
I'm not!
Huh.
Right now we have to be practical.
GET OUT!
Sort of.
...Yes.
Dick, we need some time apart --
All square, Doc.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
No. Never.
I didn't have much to do with it.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
He's a socialist, then?
Be careful, Francie.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
Please, Francie...
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Thank you.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
You can always come see it in London.
Are you really serious? About acting?
Then don't go to Hollywood.
They'll mend.
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Not me. But other people seem to.
Harry.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Kaminski.
Eight stories.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Well, the studio told me not to.
Forget it.
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
What?
Whattaya think you're in now?
Huh?
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Who?
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
How did I look?
Why do you say that?
I'm not sure.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Yes.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
What'd you do?
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
Smile, little sister, smile.
Mama, what's...
Where are you going?
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
Yes, Mama.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
I see.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
You're kidding.
Yes.
Then why weep for him?
What kindness?
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
I see it before me.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
I will not! Kill me now!
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
The world is a dizzying place.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
Now husband and wife.
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Open this door for no-one!
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
Aye, Captain.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Can you think of a better reason?
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
I resent God's monopoly.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
You've been going round-the-clock?
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Let it go.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Despite the lack of challenge.
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
Why?
The strain was evident.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
I was careless.
Thanks, Alice.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Marcie?
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
I meant everything.
Here we go.
I don't believe you...
Whatever you make yourself.
I love you.
Whassamatta?
There you are dead wrong.
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
Another coincidence.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
I have no idea.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
Jacob.
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
In heaven.
Yes.
You won't let him touch her?
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Forever together.
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Yep.
Kate, Scott?
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Yes.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
Knock yourself out.
Six-fifty.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
Feels good.
Sight seein'.
How do you know?
She's in the other room.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
No, I didn't.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
This ain't the time.
I did?
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's what you look like.
No, Richie, what do I look like?
Where are you?
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
Thank you, ensign.
Your prerogative, Senator.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Across the board, sir.
No problem, sir!
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
I was one member of the investigating commission.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Sounds familiar.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Absolutely not.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
No, ma'am.
I can make this wall without --
Sir?
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
What about him.
Yeah.  Me too.
Whose orders were those?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I think you look beautiful.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
Just askin'
Smoke it!
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
That's not right.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
O'Neil, Jordan.
You knew about us?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
The first female President?
I don't know.  Seems...
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Great. See ya then.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Nearly four years...
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Only one way to find out.
No.
It's good to see you, Nick.
What?
Sure. I'd like that.
I got pretty close.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
Really? I'd like to find out.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
Nick Tatopoulos.
What do I get?
Call me Charlie.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
I don't think so.
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Sounds like a big company.
Sure.
You were right.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
It's Raymond.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I'm... I'm shot.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
I had the shot...
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
You have a better plan, Alex?
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
The ships are gaining...
What?
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
Yes Commander?
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
We're getting major structural damage.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
The enemy is matching velocity.
We need another one.
All systems are working, Commander.
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
Something BAD happened here.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
All right. Put me back on with him.
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
Not a clue. You?
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
You smiled at me.
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
JASON...
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Gwen...
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
You are so full of shit
Almost as much as he loves himself.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Catch me later, okay?
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
But... Inside, I have seen-
You can oc that?
And determination.
Wh... Where are we?
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
Push It. Hold it down.
It doesn't have eyes.
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Pedal to the metal...
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
What does she see in them?
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
Same old story.
Yes, general.
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
Then use rocks!
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
We better, Congress invented him.
To hell with Arnold...
I'm not sure.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
Lafayette is a child!
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
George!  So good to be back!
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
Uh... none just now, but...
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
I think I heard that.
What else?  From Virginia?
We're leaving them?
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
That land belongs to the strongest.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
You're right.
So you didn't have the key with you.
So... how many movies you been in?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
That's right, me.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
What money?
Tell you what...
In the can. That the money?
Who is this?
Okay. So who are you?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Yeah? Which terminal?
He owes me money.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
What've you got?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
I know what a marker is.
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
Hey, Harry.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
You have it?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
What Get Away jet?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Ask your man here.
Twenty seven hundred.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
Wait. How about this?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
They report it to the IRS.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
You broke in?
What're you doing here?
Man, can you scream.
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Don't go out of your way.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
You thought I was faking?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Pick 'n' Save.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
You seem to feel fine about it.
Harry -
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Shylock?
Hello, Martin.
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
Thanks.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Morning, skipper.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
What?
Roger?
No.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Sounds reasonable.
What is it?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Murphy.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Conveniently enough for you.
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
Then you're a lucky man.
That's what I call a payday.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
You're more practical than superstitious.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Did you see him?
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
But, who -- ?
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Collision? With what?
If it was a ship she hit.
Doesn't matter.
Hey.
I don't know, are we?
Showing you what?
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
We hit land.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
You got that right.
Sorry.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
Yeah.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
You don't remember?
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
A what?
Better late than never.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
How should I know?
What is it now?
I just buzzed him in.
But I can't --
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
So what do you think?
What do you mean?
Huh?
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Yeah, well... hi...
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Hey Josh.
Forget it...
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Which loser?
Oh yeah.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
Bingo!
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
What, is she black now?
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
It's always closed...
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
Where did you get that?
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Yeah, thanks.
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
It just came yesterday...
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
God, fuck you!
Jesus!
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
C'mon, Seymour, please?
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Just wait here.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
Hooray for me.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
That's the spirit!
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Oh yeah?
How can you be so sure?
So, what happened?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
...I better not...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
Does that mean you don't like me?
In whatever way you think I mean.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
I-I-I...
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
But, I...
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
I am.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Right, exactly!
She's not at home?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
Why don't we start with that next week?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Don't they, though?
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Have you got that in writing? 
Does he speak English?
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
What did I do?
Has it ever done that before?
Have you ever failed?
But of course yours worked.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
This is more difficult-
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Do you ever see him?
Okay, that's no problem.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Thanks.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
The Upper West Side.
-- the sorrow --
Do I?
Get on with it, counselor!
You were the one who got me in.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
You need the exercise.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
I'll get one more reading.
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Huh?  What?
No, I just thought --
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
Wonder what?
Hi, Louis.
Hi, Louis.
I am Zuul.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
So what do you think it was?
It's in the stars.
Out!
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
I want you inside me.
Really!  Is it gone?
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
I think it's the food of the future.
Die in what sense?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
A square?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Yeah, I can smell it.
What?
What is it?
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Gozer.
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
Neutronize.  System shut.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
What do I say?
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
What?  What popped in there?
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
And the seas would boil ...
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
I'm sure, I don't know.
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
What are you talking about?
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
That's difficult to say, general.
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
We have to stop the Germans now!
Until your confirmation date.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
You don't know how wrong you are.
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
Only from a distance.
Yours will do!
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
They fear me.
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
My troops don't make policy.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
Let him trust Quintus.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
You teach them!
I killed too many barbarians.
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Alive... I'm alive...
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
I'd love some.
But, Elaine --
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Yes.
You sure you really want to?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Because I want to know what's happening.
That woman --
That woman. The older woman.
Get out of here.
Because it isn't true.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
If you want.
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
But Elaine --
I don't know.
I might.
I'll think about it.
Why wouldn't it?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
No, Benjamin.
Shhhh.
Hello -- who is this?
Mr. McQuire.
Ahhh.
Oh -- no sir.
I want you out of here.
I'm in the bathroom.
Will you bring it in to me?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
A single. Just for myself, please.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Oh no.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
It's down the hall.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
No. 
Right.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
Why not?
I'm very neurotic.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
Like what?
Well I don't know.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Sit down.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Benjamin?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Yes, I have --
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Jesus Christ!
I've got to go.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
What?
I haven't. No.
Thank you.
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Are you kidding?
INADEQUATE!
If you want.
Are you tired of it?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Don't you?
Go ahead then.
Neither.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
What one.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
What?
About five years.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Not exactly.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Don't tell Elaine.
Are you shocked?
Yes.
What?
Don't talk about Elaine?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Yes.
You're not.
I see.
Now don't start this.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
You wouldn't.
If that's how you feel --
You don't have to say that.
Then give me your word you won't.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
Yes, but I'm afraid --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Sure.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Goodnight.
No -- they don't.
That has nothing to do with it --
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
Oh no.
I've got to go.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Ben -- how old are you now?
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Yes, sir.
Oh yes.
I will.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
That's quite a statement.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
Can you look through the glass.
That what he says. Right?
Well?
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
Why?
How?
You might find a bullet through that head...
You're a fool!
Who?
Of course.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Will you do me a big favor?
Yes --
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
Yes -- oh!
Because you love me -- you love me?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
Oh -- 
I don't want them now.
No?
Not at all, sir. 
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Good heavens. What for?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
What, Doctor?
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
You don't understand that do you?
What?
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Oh yes, of course.
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
Moreover...
Moreover...
I got ten marks for that.
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Well -- you want me?
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Why not?
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
And I said we didn't.
Then, it's all over?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
We did not approach you.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
What -- what is it? Last night...
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
I don't know you.
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
No news yet?
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
I want to keep my teeth.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
And if you do it wrong?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
You know who I work for.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
But they must be! They cut glass!
I'll get you a check.
It's not your fault.
No?
Bluebell came in?
That's right.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
Well, that's good news.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
As though you do what I say.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Not very good!
What?
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
Taking you for granite?
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
I want to know everything about you.
Mama!
Oh, don't be stupid.
Yeah? How?
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
I saw her.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
But the setup's there. It's there now.
What?
For Christ's sake, why not?
Bullshit!
I'm happy the way I am.
Yes?
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Oh, yeah. That's that.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
The cemetery...
Do I know you?
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
You sure?
You're so predictable.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
Nothing.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
I don't know.
Just get on the bus.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
Michael Meyers.
Are you going to leave, too?
Can't you hold it?
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
But I've seen him!
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
Here.  Let me try.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
He's gone.
But surely Rogers isn't --
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
It's a sign.  He's come home.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
It was you.
Jamie's baby ...
Stay away, Sam.
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
I dunno, boy.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Must have changed that law.
Oh, shit.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
Go home!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
Let's talk about it some other time.
How do you know that?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
How are you, honeybunch?
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
You actually sold insurance!
I've considered that.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
To make an ass of yourself.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Thank God!
Are you--do you--
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Dad was never in England?
Tell me that.
Go on.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
No, no, no, no, no.
Sir?
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Penelope!
Leave a tip.
Nothing.
I don't want to fight you.
I'm talking to you gently now.
What time do you get off work, my child?
Daughter--I love you very much.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Situation.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
I did?
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Turn around?
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
What a honeymoon.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
What are you going to do?
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
Sneaking in the back door.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
If he thinks he's man enough.
I plan to live one hundred years!
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
He's dead, you know.
We'll miss you so.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
I came back.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
You were wrong, you quack!
You haven't heard me yet.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
I'm high as a kite.
Poison.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
Get up.
It's trash now, like mine.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
I heard you were looking for me.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
That is sad.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
I don't want to live any more.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
Stay home tonight!
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
It's beautiful.
No.
That man is your father.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
Then get him.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
He is my father.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
I know.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Far as I know.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
It's suicide!
I believe in miracles now.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
It's really that bad?
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Big threat. TV would ream you.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
Do you want to take a session?
Are you going to stiff me?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
That's all you got, three girls?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Do you know where she lives?
Three hundred?
Huh?
What rate?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
But it's all you do.
He deals in pain.
You really believe all that?
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Why can't I meet him now?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Well, what do they know?
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
No.
Who made it?
What do you mean?
But the police...
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
I just heard. Who is he?
Just leave me alone.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
How did you find me?
What plan?
Well...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
No.
That's all right.
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
You never heard of that?
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
Oh.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
You working in San Diego now?
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Hello.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Your hearse?
Oh. Eh, I like it.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Over there by the courthouse.
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
No more revolts.
With Life.
Where's that?
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Maude.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
It's true. I can't live without you.
At a funeral.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
What about the draft?
Yes.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
Yes, sir.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
Jeez! That's a great story,
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
ZAT!
Oh sure.
Yes.
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
What's the matter with her?
God, that's terrible.
What?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
Are you crazy?
What are you talking...
Then why are you here?
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Red, I found something --
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
I thought you liked being on TV.
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Who wards off demons.
Reliquary --
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
Noooo! Noooo!!!
I can live with that.
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
You call that thing a cigar??
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
No. Myers is taking me.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Marco...
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
What -- ?
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
No. That wasn't the deal.
Stay the fuck away from me.
You can keep them.
I have to speak to my father.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
Who did?
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Maybe.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Where's Daddy?
I saw everything.
I'll be scarred for life.
Just feeling a bit sick.
O.K.
Don't go upstairs.
Not much.
That's right.
No.
What's wrong?
What happened to me?
No Dad.
Never better. You sleep well.
What?
Gone?
I don't believe it.
I want to see.
So lie down.
Are you alright ?
Your father told me you were working here.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
What happened to you?
Oh, so what's the point then?
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
What do you mean, "what?"
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
How do you know about that?
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Haven't seen it.
What?
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Why?
Nobody.
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Pardon me?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Nice friend.
What's his name?
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Can I help you?
Fine.
I understand, Dick.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
I dunno.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
You really believe that?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Nevermind.
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Will you please just go?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
We'll talk some other time.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
It's me.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
It was kind of funny.
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
Those aren't mine.
No, no.  When are you going home?
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Yes, of course.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Want to know what, exactly?
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
I'm alright.
Hi.  What are you doing?
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
Are you persuadable?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
You called this morning?
Well she --
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
I'm sure it isn't.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
That way.  You?
Right.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Everything all right?
How's the store?
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Yeah.
Fine.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Basil the II.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
No one knows you're here?
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
Why are you here?
Will I see you again?
No!
Now there's a new topic.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Please go to no trouble.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
I was nearly killed.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
You're a long way from Inverness.
You are the same?
Me arm hurts.
Who?
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Far away.
Tradition.
We need more time.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
It can be different.  It must be.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
I don't know.
And the Bulgarian?
Kahn?
Sit.
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
What are you doing here?
He always did.
-Since you last saw me.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
It's all we have.
And if I refuse?
It doesn't.
That's none of your business.
Where were you Tuesday night?
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
We were very close.
Same.
Hello, Bensinger.
The poem?... The poem was great!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
Thank you.
Fine.
No -- she didn't.
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Thanks a lot.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
Say, I want to be sure, too!
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Get out of here, you!
The power of the press, huh!
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Just what I said. That's what I --
You -- you --
No!
The insurance business?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Now you got me.
What for?
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Yes. Where is he?
I'd like to think.
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
You been in a fight?
Louie!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Is this the Community Hospital?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Come here. See if we can move it.
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Who did you talk to?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Walter, you can't do that!
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
I'll have it in a minute.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Good coffee, isn't it?
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
What do I know about Williams?
What?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
An attempt to ruin us!
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Just -- one -- second!
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
I'm telling you!
What did you do with her?
All right, Judge.
Phone for you, Hildy.
I'll go right after it.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
And up a dime.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Huh?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
That's good.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
That man there!
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
Isn't that her picture?
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Keep away!
Quiet, Mollie!
Never mind! Just play dead.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
Say, Hildy...
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
I know.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Apparently so.
Who told you that?
They're not.
Bugger off.
Bloody.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Ask her yourself.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
Pauline.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
They might be.
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
It looks....foreign.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Don't be silly, Dawn.
Out.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Play something, Grace.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
I know you mean well.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Huh... what cone?
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
No, I told you...
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
Yeah, come on.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Whoopie fucking doo.
I was just wondering.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
You know... a couple of queers.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Yeah, I'll do something.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Yeah, no shit.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
How awesome?
How much further?
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
He won't move.
Yeah, showtime for what?
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Hmmmmm.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
How's he get around out here?
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Tickets for what?
That seems likely.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Sleeping.
I resign.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
You got to be fucking joking.
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
I don't know... about half an hour.
What? I didn't hear anything.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Yeah, no mercy here.
You find something, Georgie?
What do they call you, sweety?
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Huh?
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
No, just a little too old.
Sorry.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Let's go see.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
Yes, sir.
That's it?
Dr. Satan?
I always favored the Hulk.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
And think about what you've done.
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Gabrielle.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
When you were a little French girl?
Yes. Happy happy.
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Stop. Get away.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
Unnhh.
Hi. It's Nathan.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Always. Ow.
Shut up and tell me.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
Really?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
Paper or cloth?
I'm not sure.
Of course.
I think he's feral.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Sure. Of course.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
I guess.
How come?
I had sold my fucking soul.
Shit.
Lila...
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Yep.
Mm hmm.
No, I'm fine.
You know what's good for him?
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
What did he say?
Two.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Whaddya been so far?
Thanks for the drink.
For who?
You think I can lose?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
How good is he?
Come on, let's go...
I'm a businessman, kid.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
I told you you'd get your money back.
Yeah. Just like that.
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Shoot.
What?
Fine, thanks.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Then why go to the bus station?
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
Why did he tell you?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Come here. Come on, now.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Game's over, Eddie.
Let's go.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
You lived like this once.
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
What?
You're not them.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Yes.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Virginia...?
Do we have to?
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
Was there anything over the hill?
What, Jim, what?
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
Good night.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Who are you calling?
I know a way.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What happened to your other slipper?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
It's really nice of you to help us.
You have to leave the White House.
Connie, don't hang up.
David, don't...
I take it you've heard.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
What's the bad news?
Haven't you been watching?
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
Dad...
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
She didn't take my name when we were married.
It's perfect the line is busy?
He wasn't the President then.
Just getting a feel for her.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
She should be shortly.
But what, General?
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
Roger.
He's doing a good job.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Butt-munch.
I'm a dancer.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
We're leaving.
Above American soil?
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Here... now.
Die.
You are on your own?
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
I'm going after Dad.
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
How dare he?!
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
We're through!
Yes?
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Then wait -- count to twenty.
Don't call me that, please.
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
He was actually there? You saw him?
There were rats, Dad.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Yeah?
I came here to save you.
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
I know, Dad!
It happens to me all the time.
This could be close.
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
After you, Junior.
Who are you?
Come on -- come on!
I'll take the camels.
But, Indy --
No.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
My name is Kazim.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
Lao She.
Step on it, Short Round!
You don't like him do you?
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Two are still missing.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
What evil?
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
A SNAKE!!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
You got it!
What is your name?
What street?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
No. Don't tell the guards.
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
Find You?
Take a left and your next right.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
What do you mean?
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
I'm at the airport.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
You eat it.
The sand.
Eat it.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
What's happening?
.
Wait.
What?
Well you did it today.
This...is not going to work out.
Not blue enough.
The beautiful one.
Who, me?
Are you serious?
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
I don't know!
Why don't you get out of my face.
I can't keep up.
That's not funny.
What do I do?
I told you, I have a feeling...
Never mind, just say it.
Probably.
Come on.
Not sure at all.
And Dieter?
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Aim what?
What exactly?
I'll get us out of here.
That's nice.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Don't give her your name.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
What a nerve!
Who's our little man?
Then how did you know?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Yes. Joe.
What?
I feel fine.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Been hearing voices.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Thanks, I appreciate that.
Just give me the keys.
Sir?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Me still. They left you alone?
Why?
It's not apparent.
How often they come here?
Why'd you run off?
No.
Food doesn't agree with me.
Why?
One chip?
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
We figure out if it's in here.
Get us one.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
This going to work?
Can you?
You can say that again. What do we do?
Her?
You are, I've seen you.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
What about the others.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Whoever took it does.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
For reading.
Okay.
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
Lowell?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
What caliber is your gun?
No, no, we're fine...
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Catch you later.
Jim, it's Lowell.
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
I'm doing an interview.
What's the difference...
Did you say Berman?
"60 Minutes"?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
...you fucked me!
Alright.
I'll call you then.
Hardly new news.
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
What?
Oh, lots.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
They do this with impunity!
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
A delivery device for nicotine.
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
It acts as a...
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Mr. Dumbarton.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
I should be in therapy.
Got any symptoms?
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
It's your move, Miles.
So, that's good, right?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Ruth Rabino.
No.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
It's about time.
I said yes.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
Isn't everything?
But you don't agree?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Absolutely.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
She didn't love you?
She held that against you?
No, we're not!
What is it Miles?
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
Oh Miles!
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Fabric and fringe.
Hello Marylin.
I bet.
May I come in?
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
No buts. Now. Out.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
Hello Miles.
You have some?
Jesus.
Please!
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
He was right, wasn't he?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
I want to be exposed.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Thank you.
I don't know. I can assume...
Well -- is that possible?
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
HA!
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Who's Rex's guy?
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it?
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to
Do you love her?
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Oh, hello, Dad.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Oh, please, Dad
I suppose so.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Sock her!
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Huh?
Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
Are you talking to me?
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
I found it on the seat.
What are you talking about?
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Shut up!
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 
Outside!
I can't go out like this.
Yeah?
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Next week "East Lynne."
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
You always want to run everything.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
Hitch-hiking.
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Mind your own business.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Me?
I'm out! I'm out!
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Thank you.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Oh, excuse me. 
What time is it?
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I am, Joe.
For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
ain't got a hat
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Who?
Zeke.  Git!
There's a seat over there for you.
Yeah. Come oncome on!
What?
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
Huh?
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
No.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
No, I did not.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Why Galveston?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
No, you don't!
How many shots you say you heard?
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
A Perry Russo?
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Nonsense.  What next?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
They're gonna love you, chief.
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Yes.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
More than ten years.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Was he there often?
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
And what would I have to do?
I know. That's why I went.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
I understand.
Who?
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
A bit.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
Course you didn't.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
Take your time.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
It was the other guy who busted me.
Cash poor?
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
What?... What'd you do?
Why?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Bigger?
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
They seem to like the idea.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
The day you got me out of jail?
Which one?
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
What's he doing?
Did you tell him you were leaving?
I beg your pardon?
Do you live together?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Yeah?
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
Can I smoke?
You talk to him?
What did you say?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
I never have. It's not my money.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
What about me?
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Gimme one anyway.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Beaumont Livingston?
Dreaming.
Hi, Melanie.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
I told them.
They already know it's you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
A woman.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
What'd you care?
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
I can sit through it once.
Sure.
Yeah.
We had done time together already.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
Yeah.
Uh-huh?
All right already.
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Okay, Lou-is.
That's good money.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
C'mon in.
That was Beaumont.
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Not now, pick me up.
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
Twice. In the parking lot.
You know how she is.
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
We went to the parking lot.
That's right.
He's a big one. You two tight?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
You don't say.
Haven't a clue.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
House.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
Did the police contact you?
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
I thought you might be asleep.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
I know where it is.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
Then what are you doing here?
No, thanks.
Just to see you. That's all.
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
It's short, huh?
I'm hanging up.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
No. Not really ...
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
How do you know?
She talk about the boys?
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
I'm walking, aren't I?
I haven't seen her in months.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
It's freezing.
I don't want to know.
Go to sleep.
Save me!
Who did?
Thanks.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Don't ask.
I don't know.
Your kid dropped it off.
No. The little one.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Gabe.
I don't like things that make you cry.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Show me Della!
Get your clothes off.
That's your decision.
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
What? What do you mean?
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
I promise.
I love you when you're angry.
Sit down.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You've lived with me for two years.
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
One drop?
Just relax.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
I no from around here.
If you're lucky.
For what? For seeking the truth?
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Call my chiropractor.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Paul Gruneger!
I work in a bakery.
Count 'em on one hand.
Nope.
What's wrong?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
You got lucky.
What do you mean, not enough time?
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
Rizzo did.
What?!
What are you gonna do, tell me?
We could convert fission transistors.
Then stop talking and work faster!
I am an expert!
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Not a chance.
What?
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Okay, good tip.
I know you.
She needs a little time.
Oh I like her a lot.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Just come on, I've got an idea.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
Would you?
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Kay-em 14.
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
See you then . . . doctor.
Obviously so.
Get him out of there!
Exactly.
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
My boat's neat, dad!
What?
You got it.
I know who he is...
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
Where...?
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Older, sillier.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
Thank you.
No. Home here.
I didn't agree to that!
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Florida license plate.
Chum?
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
Be careful, for chrissake.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
This is quite a place.
I can't imagine why.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
That wasn't funny.
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
Twenty years.
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
And I'll drink to yours.
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Cool.
But you copy my work every week.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
What?
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
No...
Huh?
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
What are you talking about?
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
Hey, I like this.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
That suits you.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Why?
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
I actually know this one.
What are you?
But you're old!
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
I heard that was you.
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
You're pregnant?
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
There are ads? For parents?
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Right, seriously.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
I suppose anything's possible.
Carrie.
Could I try that?
It's a portfolio of my work.
No it is not!
...Anything else?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Almost.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Who?
Yeah.
Nah... how much money have you got?
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
A book on the warehouse murders?
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
How do you know that?
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
No, thanks, I can manage.
No.
No, never. Excuse me.
Siesta.
Shut your mouth.
What is it?
Without his car?
...That'd be my guess.
17.
Umm. Altogether?
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Did what take?
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Did you tell her that you loved her?
What do you want?
Den less go Joe.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Right.
Yep.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Oh. You like her?
Yeah.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
Good luck?
Yeah probably.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
You are?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Yeah. Do it again.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Yeah. I can understand that.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
But I'm scared Telly.
Nothing?
15.
One.
What?
I tested positive?
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Yeah, I guess so.
No.
Thanks.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Making love is like.
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah.
You've heard the stories right?
When are you gonna be back?
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
I don't know, eight or nine.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
No.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
What?
Maybe you should.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
Then what's he talking about?
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
What?
Run it down.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
What was your relationship with her?
Anything?
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
But a hundred men could move him.
Because she's the type.
Then call them!
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
Very good.  How did you know?
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Boys.
My cheering section.
Okay.
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Six, eight hours tops.
Bingo.
No Frank.  No prints.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
I got it from the tournament directory.
A building?
I went out.
Mate in five.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
It's alright.
When I was very young.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
Let's change the subject.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
Then show me who you are.
Call room service.
I thought you said the line was busy?
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
Can I come in?
But I do.
I got lucky.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
<u>What</u>?
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Colwyn ...
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
I'm not sure.
The Beast will kill her.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
You're coming with us.
What will happen?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
I cannot betray my bride.
I have need of friends.
How did you know I had sons?
You will follow me.
To the place where Death lives.
We must try to get horses.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
I'd wish for a puppy.
It's right behind you.
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
Hush!
Then look!
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
It is important to assure the succession.
That I am, my lady.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
Where is he? My son.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
You lie!
Yeah... How do you know it?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
What?
You were scared, weren't you?
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
What shall we do?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Yeah, what?
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
I have no fear.
Fine...
Huh? That's smart!
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh, that's good!
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
No... Dino's.
No...
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Where?
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
Thank you.
I'll kill you!
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
Okay.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
You're talking to me?
Please tell me.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
I think it's a different place for each person.
Pacifica, California.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
That's all right isn't it?
Jumped where?
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Maybe.
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
California.
Tomorrow.
I told you.
Where am I?
Good morning.
Oh, that's not mine.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
What do you think I should get?
...Noooo.
Water?
No -- S.E.R.A.
You what?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
You OK out there?
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Don't be silly?
When?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Oh, and what did you do?
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
Can we just ignore it?
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
I've been all right.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
No.
I can't tell you.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
That's not what's important.
I believe you! Don't worry.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
I guess.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Thank you.
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
What?
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
See?
Spill.
What'd you do?
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
I'm so happy for you!
I know. He has it sent out.
Really?
What?
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Margot!
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
I wasn't gonna --
But maybe it is --
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
What?!
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Oh, my God!!
Is he the only one?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Where's Warner?
Why not?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
No.
Uh -- sure.
See?
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Faith.
Purely a precaution...
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Kill me... I want... so nice...
Oh, yes...
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
And if she thinks me a liar?
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
And who might that be?
It would appear so.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Whatever for?
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
What know you of fields of war?
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
We'll find it.
The chill is worse this night.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Been telling you that all along, lad.
It doesn't matter.
What weapon?
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
Don't get too far!
Never show mercy!
He'll not escape me.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
I'll try.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
If you like.
Or perchance...
Sport, indeed.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
What's the matter?
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
She's dead!
You'll visit again?
And sweet?
You... you... you mortal you!
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
May God protect you.
The Black Baron, you say?
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
To Castle Couer de Noir?
You follow.
I thought I might stop by.
Sam!
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
I would have anyway.
Uh...using Josh like that.
I'll survive.
Nope.
Monday.
What did you think it would be?
You look better without make-up.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I'll get your back.
Yeah.
Why?
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
I'm not gay.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Floating to Catalina.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
Will he talk to me?
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
I flushed it down the toilet.
It's thirty feet.
What are you on?
how much weight have you lost?
I'm not.
I hate this job.
For everything.
She didn't really say.
Thank you.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
Why would you be there?
I'll get your bag.
I warned you yesterday.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
It'll be fine.
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
You'll have money when you work for it.
Oh, okay.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
Don't.  I don't want it.
How do you become something you're not?
Nothing.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
That's so weird...
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
Are you taking them still?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
I can die trying.
I know there's an explanation.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
She's a little sad, is all.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I can't leave the house?
Let's go.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
I can't pick you up.
I didn't think you'd come today.
You got any weed?
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
The payoff.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
Should I?
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Please don't leave me.
Sam took them to a movie.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
Someone stop her!
Better make it a week.
Is Mae Rose okay?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
But you can't.
Is Spanky here?
Then what's the problem?
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
I don't think so.
Claude Banks.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Here I am.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
It ain't here.
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Forget it.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
I'm stuck!
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Say what?
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
What am I gonna eat?
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
Go where, Ray?
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Why the hell not?
Yeah? You and what army?
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
You heard what the man said! Move it!
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
Just like Elvis.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Are you offering me a bribe?
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
He's sick?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
All right. Let me out.
You mother...
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Sure, why not?
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
Release the evil?
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Everything's fine, pop.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
How bad?
Son, just do your best.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
What was it called, sir.
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
We know where to find Nicky.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
Really?
Why are you laughing?
My dad's an optometrist.
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Sometimes, sure.
Basically, yeah.
What are you doing?
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
From my dad's side of the family.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
Anything to eat?
From? From? From?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Up there.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Just wondered... what happens?
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Only a few? You're just not trying.
I'm in my party mood.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Did you?
I'm Mary 2.
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
No.  Just no.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Curious.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I let him go... believe me.
You're not going, are you?
Some people say children need human mothering.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
How will they know we're coming?
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
We'll be all right...  We will...
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
It could be...
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
I don't know.
No.
What's that?
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
Not yet.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Okay.
They're comin' with us.
What?
Sure, I'm okay.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
Right... This just glided along.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
Me, too.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
We killed him.
Yes, I believe so.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Do ya good.
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
Did you tell the police this?
His physical condition.
We'll get a tail put on him.
Coming up.
A headache?
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
My... My head.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
No, nothing.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Yes, I just found it on the step.
Why would anyone do something like this?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
Just a minute.
What job?
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
I can see that.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
You really don't remember?
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Come on.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Well, what do you know about that!
I see.
Now you're irritating and absurd!
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
I'll say.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
All right.
No.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
So there are others?
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
You have no disputes over women?
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
They were.
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Yes, charming.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
Now, what would you like to do?
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Thank you.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Father Perrault is dead.
Yes.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Hey!
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
Right, Bob.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Porters?
Why - I'm sorry - but I
You can't leave, George.
So you think I'm mad?
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
Yes.
Yes, everything!
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
What if he refuses?
Where are we going? Huh?
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Yes, I know.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
You see, it's not a dream.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Struggling, why?
Why, mother?
It's Fenner.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
All right, I'll be there.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Cowan--
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
I guess I lost:
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
I'd go with number three.
Kay, I'm sorry...
What?  Who the hell are you?
Right.
She didn't even know you. .
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
It was a long time ago.-
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Let's check am out.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
And what's this ... ?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
We're rising.
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Do his job.
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
There wasn't time, sport!
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Do have any idea what I just said?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Out of focus?
How could it not?
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Yeah, Kay?
Noon exactly.
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Will it lower the curve?
The what?
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
Did it leave?
He'll turn around.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Who wanted her little girl back?
She died?
That's comforting.
Right.  I know --
It's all I could safely move.
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
Yes, you did.
Drowning.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
... Graveyard shift.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
I'm not getting halo'd.
I show a cop on horseback.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
No maglev system.
Did he close the front door?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
That's right.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
What the fuck is going on?
Kill me!
You say some of the children died?
Not if I stay away from him.
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
The female.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Lamar --
My God...
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
He's my subordinate!
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
We can stop him.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
Who?
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Yes.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
But John was with him at the pool?
To what?  Trap him?
You're Bobby, right?
When served warm --
What's 'incidentals?'
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
What if I gave you forty?
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
She's, uh, sleeping.
He's not doing it.
Chloe?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
With what?
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
She'll be out in a minute.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
Yeah?
Ruiz tied in out there?
Me? No. Not really.
She was fast, huh?
I don't understand.
Ruiz knows about this?
What is it?
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
You don't know where you're going?
Yeah.
It's important.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
He's not here.
It's not losing record.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Yeah. I know the number.
Bye.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Who's driving her?
Pretty nice.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
Well, I don't want to walk.
Fuck...
What the fuck do you...
Don't even start.
I mean, that's what I heard --
About what?
Fuck this.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
I don't want to take any more chances.
You're not getting a gun.
I'll be a minute.
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
You want your surprise?
Well, come on then. It's back here.
I didn't do anything --
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
Ugh...
Yes.
Where do you live?
'Strapped?'
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
What? Why am I bad?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
How's it going?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Different.
We're going to New York?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Tell me.
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
But, Max --
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
That's none of your fucking business.
Man's rep travels.
I'm working on it.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
I'll take your goddam bet.
You never had it.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
You know it.
There's two guns on you.
Now.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
What?
How do you like it?
Why do you ask?
How old are you, Betty?
Yes.
Because you're in trouble.
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
Shhh!
Let's get out of this cold.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
You put it very well.
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
The hell you are.
I ain't doing bad.
Yeah.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
That's right.
He's bright.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[What is his name?]
[Daniel what?]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[And?]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
Yes.
I drink.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
Why not?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
It's better to be free, right?
Where?
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
I know you're not.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
Do you know what she told me last night?
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Our daughter.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
That's what friends do.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Oh, yeah.
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Your son Marty?
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
I'm thirty-four.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Thank you.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Oh, I'm fine.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Please...
Nothing.
Nothing.
No, I'm not kidding.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
Sure, great if you ain't married.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Put on your blue suit...
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Sure.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Waddaya read there, Joe?
Well...
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
I don't wanna talk about it!
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
How you, Radar?
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
There's only one way.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
The chest-cutter.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
I can't... couldn't.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Right.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Radar!
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
What do we do?
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
Not necessarily.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
It's possible
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
You're leaving tomorrow?
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
That. It's out of the act.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
I don't think so either.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
You mean who hit who?
Yes, sir?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Oh, get out of here!
Morning, Radar. How were things?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
Against what?
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Hello.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Thirty dollars.
A hundred dollars!
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Oh!
Oh!
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Thank you.
I used to pitch.
Where is she?
Shut up!
. . . Tubby?
The heelots!
The heelots!
What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
You betcha.
Yeah. It certainly is.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Huh? Get what?
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
No.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Nineteen!
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
What?
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
Good. I don't want to be late.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Huh?
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Sorry... Habit.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
You living together?
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
To run late!
The jockey!
You got a bet on the game tonight?
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
Mmm, needs a little something.
Yeah that's it.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's very nice.
...Let me just show you.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
What?
Define concern.
Your concern is heartwarming.
Who's running it?
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Yes.
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
About what?
Someone who believes in miracles.
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
It's his nature.
Who?
There is no --
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
What?
It's not used for anything.
Try harder.
Where?
Tanner.
Her?
It was a test.
Way you kiss me.
There?
Checking connection.
-- Transmit now!
Male.
-- Standard.
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
What?!
Yeah, right.
WHITE TIGER!
Activating Power Beam!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
What's a Triac?
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
We can take these guys!
Release the power with the power.
LET'S FLY!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
Look closer.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
How about Major Moron?
Wait for me!
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
GO IVAN!!
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
And I ain't no nigger either!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Not another word.
You scare me, Charlie.
No. Not everything.
I guess I am. Just a little.
Scared.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
You got men on Profaci's place?
Who hired the bastard?
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
It's too late.
It always is.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
Who?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
Never threaten me, Boss.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
But that's an hour's drive.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
The name's Charlie.
I found that out.
That's why I'm here.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
I turned him down flat.
We can operate around these guys.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Fuck 'em.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Uhh - martini?
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Thank me next time you see me.
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Why?
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Maybe you could talk to Death!
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Got a doctor on duty.
Who?
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
When'd you get in?
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
We like to think so, yeah.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
I'm good.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
Mm hmm.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
Mm hmm.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
And where is she?
This way?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Looks like it, but--
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
What do I play?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
My friends?
Waiter!
Shut up, Diz.
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Again? Good idea.
I'll cherish ya.
Tunnel?
We're gonna get married.
Okay--I mean--
You said it!
Right now--everything I own--!
Huh?
Take me home, Diz.
Why me?
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
How do you feel, champ?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Oh--Jim!
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Emma!
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
What?
We'd better see.
You're a liar!
Office of--Senator Smith?
Most natural thing in the world!
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
Right.
Some committee's got it.
*This* is.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
No.
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Go right ahead.
Terrible, thank you.
No!
Second drawer.
Not another bill?
Are you drunk?
I'm not.
Oh--Saunders--
To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Goodnight, Senator--
Well--I--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Susan!
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Jim, I won't stand for it.
It's crucifying him--!
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Page boys!
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Some people like it.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Uh-huh.
Yes, indeedy.
What's that got to do with it?
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Uh-huh.
Oh, that
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Let's just walk, okay?
Are you? When?
Yes, of course.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm crucifying him.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
With pay!
Uh-huh.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Yes.
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Perfect! Perfect!
I wanna see that guy!
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
This is outrageous!
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Wants to know who the heir is.
See you later, kid.
All set.
All right.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Nah.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Me?!
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
I don't know.
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
Don't pay any attention to her.
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Yes, ma'am.
Excuse me. What did you say?
I did what!
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Uh-huh. What are they?
Take your time.
Why's that?
A friend?
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
My approach?
How do you mean?
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Stop now.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
What?!
And the experiment is in here?
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
You've done well.
What do you think's wrong with her?
I do.
Yes, your honor.
I'm sorry, your honor.
What?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
Doc.  Ainge...
Why do you watch?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Okay.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
-- Go on!
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Mother... go away!
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Is she against you getting help?
Uh-huh.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
Of course.
Of course.
I don't follow you.
Okay...
I think so.
What was that?
Hello.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
Anything... just ask.
It's called pro bono.
What do you want me to see?
Was it something that happened at school?
True. Should we stop them?
This --
Uh-huh.
I wondered what happened to her...
Jerking off?
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
You don't think I'm insane?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
It's not?
Just you.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
It wasn't the best situation.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
Things got a lot worse.
I'm honored.
You're completely reliable.
Wow.
Yep.
When?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
You're not going to kill us?
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
I've had worse.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Oh yes, always.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Correct, And that's when --
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
To be hanged.
I am an English woman.
Twenty.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
You swear?
Want to know?
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
The things that get you excited.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Got what?
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
That just makes you more gullible.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Did you ever see him eat?
Shut-up and get me off of here!
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
What?
Of course.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Your mind is so slippery.
Fantasizing... about you.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
He was cute though.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Or even what it looks like.
Hello?
Thanks.
Ummm.
You're nuts.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Just a waitress.
Sure -- I guess.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Not tonight. 
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
What have they got that we ain't got?
What are you talking about?
What?
Monica!
I just know.
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
My heart died a long time ago.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
We had an off night, that's all.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
Are you coming or not?
There's a vague similarity.
Oh shut up.
He hasn't stolen it yet.
Come on.
No.
Hey... he's gone.
Oh hi, Mom.
The who?
Whatever our name is.
Through there!
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
I think it's absolutely charming.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
What do you have in mind?
Cavalry?
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
And where is Joseph?
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am.
Ajaccio.
Oh?
I very much doubt that he will.
I'll have the fire built up.
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Yes, I am, sir.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Lisette.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Yes.
No.
One had better legs.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
I cannot promise you that.
I know what you're doing in there.
Yes.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
It's me.
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
There's probably some explanation.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
God help me -- yes.
Yes?
Yes.
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
That is correct.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
And I can go free?
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
What happen?
You know what he mean, dude.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
Out the door and to the left.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's locked.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
All damn.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
What up, bro?
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Let it go!
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
And some rolling papers.
Thanks for the help.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
Yeah.
I don't know the number.
I'll take you later.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Shut yo' ass up.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
What?
Sorry.
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
What?
My security people are right next door.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
For not believing you.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
Keep your voice down.
That's right. That gives you...
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
I think you're right.
No, kisses to...
I'm just an accountant.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
Keep it.
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
What!?
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
What?
I see. Where is this gun?
No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
Everybody does?
I've done much better ones than this.
You're a big girl, huh?
Why?
A surprise?
Yeah.
It better be.
Where?
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
Go ahead, sugar Die.
What gives?
No.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
You, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
And I won't never tell about the money.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
They hid in a broom closet!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Mister Powell!
Yes, I reckon that's it.
John, where are we g --
Nothin'!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
I'll tell.
Don't you believe me?
That's no secret. I'm five.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
All right.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Our honeymoon.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Harry, what --
It's about that John and that Pearl?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
When did I ever?
Now who was this?
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Jesus.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Hi.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
My dream.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
What?
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Krueger.
School.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
So he's alive?
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
No.
Have you any money?
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
And there?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Eight forty-two, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Certainly.
That's perfect!
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
Get out of here!
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
Comrade.
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
No, thank you.
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
Well, we're back home.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
What business?
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
You're welcome.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
I'll try.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Go ahead.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohme... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Thank you.
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
Then how did you get here?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
At what?
No.
Yes.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
I promise... I swear.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
What, darling?
Yes... a little white house.
All right, we'll make it red.
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
Who cried that one?
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
Please.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Oh, yes.
No.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Is this your new dress suit?
Am I interrupting?
How do you do?
Months, Swana.
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Hello.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
I must ask you to leave.
Madame, if you...
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Go on.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Yes.
May I ask why?
No.
Yes... leaving immediately.
Where is that?
Where is it?
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
How so?
Yeah?
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
That's what they're doing.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Jesus!
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
What?
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
For God's sake, when does this end?!
No ...
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
What ... ?
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
What?
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
Winning?
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Yes, Mr. President.
How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
Free, if you're the president.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
Ernie Davis.
Elvis I like, too.
Yes, I understand that.
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
No, sir ...
I know ...
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
It's over, Dick.
I want a divorce.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
Is that the truth?
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
I've missed you.
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
Don't be ridiculous!
You're drunk!
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
How's that?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
In Angola. Yeah.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
When did he die?
Most don't.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
You ain't heard from him?
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
No.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Llewelyn Moss?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Mm.
Gun out and up.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
I never do.
I can't plan your day.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
Well I didn't see it.
No. But I gave my word.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
At the gettin' place.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
You should be used to that.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
Why would I let you do that?
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I know something better.
You from around here?
With what?
You already asked me that.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Well...
I could come back then.
You said that.
You live in that house behind the store?
You married into it.
No.
Uh-huh.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
What room?
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
That's not an answer.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
I'm sorry.
The what?
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
I'm retired.
I'm a welder.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
You do, I reckon.
No sir.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
Yeah?
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
I know plenty.
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
I am?
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Yeah, me too.
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
You're late, Eric.
Yes, she is.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
What happened when you were twelve?
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
Didn't I?
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
What?
I got you, Del...
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
I begged him to let me put that on!
I'll go to the Hospital.
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
How many men have I talked to?
Who?
You never know who you'll see.
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
No, that should be more than --
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
I... I don't know...
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Like... us?
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
What's wrong with you?
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
...who doesn't?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I said I'll think about it.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Better.
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
"A Reason to Love."
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
Good Lord, what do we do?
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Where's Tommy?
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Helluva awgazation.
Not out the other side his face, though.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
Not your...
Well sure, honey, but...
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
Pete, don't be ignorant-
Million point two.
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Isn't it, uh...
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Blooey!
Great.
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Yeah, I know.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
A long time ago.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Well, goodbye.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
I called you Sarge.
No.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
I'm a little late, that's all.
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Great.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Seriously.
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Be a friend. Leave.
Any time, sailor.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
So?
I bet you do!
That's brilliant.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
God.
Remember that.
I can't...
This is ridiculous...
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
You know how this gotta end.
Not that one.
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
I don't get it.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
How many more do we have after this?
Well, I know that now.
People.  In the house.
What do they want?
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Feel okay?
They're coming in here, aren't they?
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Little bit.  Yeah.
I am.  I'm here.
"Titanic."
Blue is phones?
He --
I was trying not to tell you...
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Who's they?
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Can you make a deal with them?
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
Wait a second there brother...
No man. Gonna walk.
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
They were empty...
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Later for that. I'm done either way...
All of the above, man...  And then some.
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Why didn't you tell me?
You don't look alright.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
I don't know. I really don't.
Thank you.
Pride will do.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Very well, proceed, sir.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
The middle colonies?
It's safer if we stay together.
Yes, sir.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Flanking riders?
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
No...
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
That's right.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
He left us.
Thirteen years...
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
You said bribery twice...
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
When?
Long time.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Four, five miles.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
For what?
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Quiet.
Well...I guess not.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Yayyy!
I hate that smell.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
You're telling me.
I guess so...but...
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Did you see his shirt?
It's beautiful!
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
You're doing fine.
She.  Goes.  Free.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
All right then.
What're you suggesting?
Aye, for us there is.
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Thank you, sir.
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Can I trust you?
Then why aren't you eating?
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
I can't breathe.
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
More to drink!
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
We're not going to just surrender!
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
I don't think that will be necessary.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
You threatened Miss Swann.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
This way!
It's the right way.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Yes, I have.
... no.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
My apologies, Governor.
No.  She hasn't.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
It's ready now, I know it is.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
Nebbleman.
That remains to be seen.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Considering what?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
The nanobot is gone.
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
The trunk.
Shut up and do it!
You better quit pushing me, pal.
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
Who isn't?
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
I guess I should be flattered.
The nanobot.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
Got it.
No, why?
What?  What's wrong?
What about it!
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
Yeah.  Old times.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
No problem.
The nanobot... it's not here...
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
On the counter.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Let's go.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Yes.
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Don't worry, four eyes.
Dexter.
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
No - give you another guess.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Gallagher?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Your house?
You can't walk out of here like this.
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Oh, man!
Well, I should say!
Yeah - go on.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Well - it's only April.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Yes, sir.
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
I'm not quitting!
Your valet, sir.
Dawson, sir.
Oh no, sir!
Thank you, sir.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
I hope you'll be very happy.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Yes.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
You quit trying to stop anybody
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
You don't.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Double strength!
I beg your pardon?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
I understand, sir.
The name is Smythe.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Now the lady said you may go
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
No, sir!
Yes, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
Well sir, I'll show you.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
That's all I wanted to know!
Sure.
What do you mean?
We're in Pleasantville?
It can't be possible.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
In my handbag.
Looks just like it did.
Thanks ... I love you.
Here's my favorite.
No ...
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
She won't go out with me?
No it couldn't!
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Rain.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Why am I out of order?
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
What?
Yes.
What are you doing?
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
As a matter of fact he does.
I don't think so.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
He won't notice anyway.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
Well if I don't who will?
I just don't think we have the right to ...
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
What?
I told you. I'm like positive.
Oh ... Hi.
They just grow like that?
Rain.
I'm not sure.
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
Nice ... Nice ...
Ooomph?
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Yeah ...
Yeah ...
Just listen to me ...
... What's that?
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
Just a little--You know.
What's the rush?
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Hey.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
So you can't talk to me?
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
That's it.
Somewhere in Utah.
D&D Mattress Man.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Why?
That's your fault not mine.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
No.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
I have work, I can't leave.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
What?
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
I....please don't do this.
I just want to know where she's staying.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
This is Georgia.
I'm in my bedroom.
Are your pants off?
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
No.
I know I did. But I don't.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
Yeah.
Hi.
Yeah, not really.
Ok.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Yeah.
You were talking about the promotion --
Yeah.
Nothing.
Did something happen; are you alright?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Lena?
About six months ago. Why?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
This is nice.
Yeah.
What is this?
For what?
Ok, bye, bye.
Did you do it?
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Why? ...what?
I know.
Sorry.
Yes it is.
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
That was weird. I meant good.
And I'm sorry that I did that.
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Yes I'm fine.
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
WHICH?
Where you goin?
Ok.
Yeah.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
What are you doing?
Right now, you're doing nothing?
You can't be late.
Seriously.
I'll see you there.
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
I thought Latisha said you would --
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
I'm sorry. You're right.
Should I call you later?
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
By whom? The Marquis?
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
Do I have your word?
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
A man after my own heart...
Coulmier, you animal!
I know, because I felt it myself --
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
Shut down?
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Of course.
No. It most certainly was not.
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
You'd suffer in her stead?
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Quite.
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
No. But tell him I would.
I pray you: be succinct.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
I am not a wealthy woman.
What thought is that?
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Very much.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Not you too
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
I can't
And director.
I'll remember that.
Do you?
Uh-hub.
Yeah
You know that can't happen.
Don't
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
How much?
Yes.
You needn't use that language with me
I will not have this in my home.
Sir? 
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Uh-huh
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Forget it-
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Please don't say this.
Listen to me-
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
Christ.
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
That's for me to decide.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Get out.
Again
The ad..
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
I really think you're
It was a -joke, George
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
It was fun, wasn't it?
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
And where you goin'?
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Where's your wife, Jake?
Nothing...
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Hit me in the face.
Jack! Enough!
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Give me a chance. Let me look.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
What did Tommy say?
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
So what?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
You sound bitter.
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
It's OK.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
What did I say?
I never noticed his face.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
You did?
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
Why don't you just call him?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Excuse me for living.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
Oh. When are they expected home?
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
That's what they call a family problem.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
Do that.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
What time?
Who left -- where?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
Oh -- I almost forgot!
You figured that out, huh?
All the things I hate.
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
Who are you?
I don't know what you mean.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
She expects me to marry her.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
And some man will lose his.
Get back there! He'll see you!
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Uh-huh.
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
There's something buried there.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
To bail Lisa out of jail.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Tired?
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
You mean "goodnight."
Without any future?
Tell me about it.
Homework. It's more interesting.
Something too frightful to utter.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
There's nothing to see.
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
Not yet!
It doesn't make sense to me.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Still -- those witnesses.
That's a suitcase?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
Is he cleaning house?
I'm glad they let you out.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
What?
Know the Millertown bluff?
Hi.
Yeah.
Smashed the front door.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Yeah!
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Sorry.
That's right!
No.  I don't think so--
What?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
What's a chickie-run?
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Judy.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Come on!
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
I need it.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
Just tell a little white lie?
Grandma?
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
No.
And your folks didn't understand?
So then you moved?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
What?
Pretty mixed up?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Listen--
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Dig the square wardrobe!
Oh.
A what?
I'm not so bad.
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
I'm numb.
Why?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
I felt like it.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
I bet you hear everything I say!
I don't know.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You disappointed?
It is for me too.
We have to go back!
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
It's all right.
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
We were romantic then too--
Hi.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
...whoever she is.
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
He'll be dead when he does.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
Radio said.
What.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Tell me again.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Nick...
Your brother...
Nick, no --
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
They're truck drivers.
Nick...
You saved me.
What?
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
The hell I can't.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
More than you know.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
At least gimme video poker.
...never... tried...
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
'Tis the season, convict.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
Take 'em.
And where they hide the real money.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
OPEN IT!!!
Mr. Bangs.
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Acid-chewer.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Five years. Since it opened.
Ain't there yet.
Yeah.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Alamo...
And you set me up.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
But... I had a five...
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Who?
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
Pam Grier.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
...What bar?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
You can do some crazy things with it.
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
Why am I Mr. Pink?
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
What do you care?
Sorry, it's my book now.
Don't ask me that.
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
It's a surprise.
No, I'm not!
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Uh-uh, just cops.
What do you think?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
I think he's just passed out.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
I don't know anybody.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
He asked.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
What are you gonna do about him?
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Look of things, she doesn't.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
As far as -- Sonora?
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
I suppose it is.
The who?
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Maybe it's better that way.
What?
I suppose that's my fault.
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
It's going to Sonora.
Maybe they will.
So did I. They were in it.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
And meet him there.
I won't again.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
I don't care.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
There aren't any women here.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Yeah.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
How many ways can a man say no.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Good night, Steve.
That's the end of the line.
I think he wants me.
Do I know you?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Sure. We can practice talking.
Shhh!
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Great!!!
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Can you feel that?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Listen to me I --
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
So, whatever happened to her?
It's okay.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Not in a thousand years.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Just wait, you'll see.
Alright, let's take a vote...
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
You do.
Second best.
My help?
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Because she will lie?
My holy water.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Dog, you look hot.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
Get out?! What does it say?
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Mother? 
No more violence... No more violence...
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
Always the dentist.
I certainly did not.
She sure can pick 'em!
Thanks, Mom.
Oh Mom...
I'm so happy I could shit.
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
I beg your pardon?
GODDAMN YOU!
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
It's sugarless.
We all have bad nights. 
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
Yes, but I lent it...
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Now, here's a babe!
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Sure I do.
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
You think my sister is there?
Yes.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
I did her hair.
No. She asked about the trademark.
She showed me a drawing.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Why?
But you have treated me that way.
Yes.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante.
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Good-bye.
Yes.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
But why come to me?
Why not let your publisher judge that?
You don't expect me to do that do you?
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
It might have.
That's too bad.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
What did he say?
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
I feel like they do.
Kids? What about them?
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Ann. Hello.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Why not?
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
I'm sorry this came up.
What difference does it make why I do it?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Absolutely not.
Why?
Yes.
No.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
So you lied to her?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I'm not planning on it.
Why not?
But I don't understand --
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
But I'm not.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Did you find him attractive?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Well, I wonder why.
He doesn't have a phone.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Let me talk to him first.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Why did you do that?
Did he touch you?
You are in trouble.
I can't believe you did that!!
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
I don't want to discuss it.
Well. I can't stay.
So will you, someday.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
You want me to leave?
I just want to ask you questions.
Just a moment.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Different.
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
I like the way he dresses.
I just... Ann is very...
You trust him.
What do you mean?
It hurts that you would say that to me.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
It'll just be me.
Will you lease month-to-month?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
I like having the car, the car is important.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
John Millaney.
Yeah.
Hi. Want a drink?
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
No, nothing.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Uh, OK. Sure.
OK. But late.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
It's crazy.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
OK. I'll think about it.
Huh?
BREAKING OUT
Of course.
A wreck.
Time to check with Flavors.
What?
He needs help.
I've caught it once or twice.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Dentonvale has been sold.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Everything's free there.
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Indulge?
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Of course.
Who?
YOUNG BLOOD
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Fabulous!
Fast!
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
It'll just take a second.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
I love you.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Bottle.
Say, is Maya working?
I'm good.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
That's on us.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
I am one of those guys.
Well, in that case...
I can't help the traffic.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Yeah, Conundrum.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
Now we're talking.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
So you're going to stop acting?
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
She works for tips!
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Nah. I want to watch this.
Okay! Fuck!
Shut up. Shut your face.
Okay! Jesus!
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Understanding of what?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
What? Of course I like Christine.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Yeah.
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Could be anything.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
No.
It's private.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
I don't have to.
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Huh. Let me think.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
What's that?
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
Quite a week.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
You said it looked like a car accident.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
I finished it.
The Windmill.
I know. I love that.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
What was the bottle that did it?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Um... yeah but it's more...
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Sure.
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Well, nice to see you now.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Ken.
So what's happening with your book?
I am.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
About a year.
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Where?
Does she ever answer back?
I heard them Morgan.
That's weird.
I'm here.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
Yes it was.
Yes, it was.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
It's old Morgan.
Don't do it.
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
Six months.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
What do you mean, the horses?
That's why they got you in jail?
You're in here for winging a guy?
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
McKendrick.
Did it seem short to you?
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
I just came out to say goodbye.
This is a brutal land.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
I already did that.
That I do.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
And they were two of them. Look --
Not for five years.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
It's a town...
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
I understand.
No hard feelings.
I'll be around.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
We didn't get that far.
All I did was kiss the girl.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
Let's get out of here.
Really?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
I was afraid of that.
Who did it?
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Because they enjoy it.
Where's Emmett now?
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
Luck, I guess.
So we understand each other?
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Stella.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
Who?
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Spare me.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
I'll send you her resume.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
Excuse me?  Start?
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
Impossible.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
How much wine have you had?
It was a great show, Dad...
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
You don't secretly want the attention?
Hello, Hal.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
This week anyhow.
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
Is she here tonight?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
If anyone asks about Simone --
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Precisely.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
No, that was me.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
-- I bet you have.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
Maybe he's talking to himself.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
My God, you've got one?
Long live the First Amendment.
What do you want -- ?
I don't understand.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Thank you.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Tell me.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Thanks.
Congratulations.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
Words.
Who me?
Yes.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Your eyes told me.
Them?
Don't fail me.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Yes.
Yes, it did.
Yes, I am.
I definitely won't.
Oh.
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Yeah.
Dead people.
What?
They used to hang people here.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
Who!
S-ssssstop it!
Chuck E. who?
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
I didn't do anything --
No shit.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Book of Jeremiah.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
I thought you said two hundred.
Manure... is life.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Metaphysical question, man.
Harvest moonshining!
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
I don't think so.
People say he was a murderer.
I --
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
What's wrong?
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Look. You want to talk about this?
You never had trouble communicating before.
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
That's not funny.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
I'm sorry.
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Shelby --
Sorry.
My present?
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
What other stuff?
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Your what?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
You know how rumors start.
How much style?
You paying for the gas?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Okay.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Shoot.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Yeah?
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
Another time.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
See.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Redneck heaven.
Can a pig whistle?
Save it. We got a long haul.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
What's your twenty?
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
You okay?
It's gonna be close. Real close.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
About one to five years worth.
Yes, ma'am.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
You have a butler working that floor?
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Yeah, why.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Yeah... Sid?
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
What's the time frame?
Leave the light off.
A puppet.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
Whose side are you on?
How quickly?
Yes.
That depends.
Shut up.
I don't know.
She drank liquid oxygen.
Get out --
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Just get him to stop.
Yes.
Her oxygen would have run out.
Why?
Rheya.  Not here.
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
I did too.
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I think so.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
You... she said I didn't love her.
No.  I love you.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Do you?
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
I'm disgusting.
You should have told me.
I never said I didn't.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
When?
We want to talk freely.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Queens... You know Queens?
Beg pardon?
Not too sure about that.
Yeah.
Urdu and Hindi.
You don't like him, do you?
I'll miss you, Mike...
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Claire...!
Let go!
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Oh God, that's great!
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
I know.
I know.
Long enough.
So.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Just putting in an appearance then.
What?
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
I think -- she's crazy.
It's not your taste.
I had to follow her to a store.
I'll be right up.
What're you talking about --
No.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
Call a cruiser!
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Ever shot anyone?
Does it make you... hard?
I'll prove it!
I'm not lettin' no one go.
What the fuck you doin'?!
Mom and I got plans.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Let me see.
I know.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
Right.
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Even if they're not clever.
What if you get hurt?
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
It'll shut itself off.
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
I will finish what I've begun
I heard about Thorkel's order--
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Imagine how I feel.
No, no!  Not there!
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
Plenty.
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Looks good outside.
We'll get some more.
Who is it?
Yeah. Security.
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
You stink, Sefton!
And maybe a little something else?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Let's!
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
No?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
Let me alone.
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Anything else?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
A little weak today.
Are we boring you?
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
What did you say?
What time?
Ich weiss alles.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Where is he?
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
The station complement was nineteen.
I hope so, sir.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
You're in the Nexus.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
It's our pleasure.
No, no. Thank you.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
I thought you might.
No.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
No, sir.
Understood. That will be all.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Thank you.
Aye, sir.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
What did you see, Chekov?
Scotty...?
What is it?
... Fascinating.
Underground deposit?
... Or <u>who</u>.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
Yes. And I know you.
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
What about surface life signs...?
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
No, sir, no response.
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Any time.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.

Wait!... Wait...
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Thank you.
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
And who am I hiding from?
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
I have my orders.
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Carol!
But we can't just sit here -- !
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
What?
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
The Admiral's son.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
Raise them --
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
KHAN!
Listen to me -- you men and women --
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Aye, sir.
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
A few shots, sir.
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
To be sure, Captain.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
How far?
Yes.
It would explain a great many things --
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
Aye sir --
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Or the one.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
You earned it.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
Who?
At what.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
Try again.
Battle stations.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
I'll try, Captain.
Aye, sir.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Just a couple of kooks...
Yeah.
What do you mean?
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Come on, Pavel...
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
... My God...
That is what I said, Doctor.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Name?
I'm wery sorry, but --
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
I buy that. What about him?
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Go ahead.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
It's his way.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
You want the details?
Noon tomorrow...?!
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
Kirk. They're gone.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
... You have a point...
Permission granted.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
You've programmed that from memory...?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
How do you know this...?
Yes.
Ah... The giants.
The hell I can't
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Right.  Will you help us?
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
I will, Admiral.
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Yes, sir.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Out of control, and blind as a bat!
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Tell her I feel fine...
Sulu Hikaru.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Androids... don't have...fun.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
From the mission...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
It is not over.
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Scan for lifesigns.
May I talk to you alone?
Fail-safe?
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
Options?
Remind me to lodge a protest...
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Deck ten.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Transferring controls to manual.
No, sir...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
But it's comfortable.
Activating injector assembly.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
At least four hours.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
I do not know what you are referring to.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Ready quantum torpedo.
Where's the Sphere?
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
I told you, there's no --
Understood. Keep me informed.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Great name. French?
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
No. It's a lot further than that.
No... I'm from France.
On screen.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Steady as she goes.
Go to manual.
We've lost Bridge control!
Nothing.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
Riker here.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
We DO sleep lying down.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Don't remind me.
That cunning little Vulcan...
If they're even looking for us...
Come on...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
They'll make it look like an accident...
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
I'm not sure how to take that.
I beg your pardon?
You feign ignorance?
He just tried to save him!
I am.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
I know what you mean...
Uhura, monitor!
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
They'll be here...
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Energize...
Captain, if --
Aye, sir.
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
You hear that?
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
You have personally -
I am uncertain.
Spock, you want to know something?
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
Not as yet, sir.
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Confirmed, Captain!
What's left of it.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
I think  not.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
This one can.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
He turned out all right.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
Dying?
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
Sorry, sir.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Good work. The download?
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Fire!
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
Do you have a moment, sir?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
And I you.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
Counselor?
This isn't real.
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Theories?
Sir?
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
Not with the Romulans.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Aye, sir.
Thank you, sir...
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Counselor?
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
She's a predator.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
Yes.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
I have no reason to.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Yes.
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
You know that's not possible.
I am.
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
What about Picard?
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
It is... invigorating.
Find her again.
Seven minutes.
She is here.
None.
I came this far alone ...

And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
How much are your rooms?
We should have. Let me see.
I make maps.
No.
Thank you.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
It's taken on a disguise.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
Okay...
Watch it. They're coming out.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
What.
Good.
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
From?
Candy.
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
No.
When we get here.
Is that a baby?
Why?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
I do not speak English.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
I was afraid.
It was a mistake.
Yes?
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
What is hell?
Are you my friend?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Yes.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
On the radio they say it's good.
I must meet my ship.
I feel better if I move.
You promised.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
You're damn right I am.
I understand.
Yes, they are.
I know how to gamble now.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Yes.
I will say that we can be friends.
If you want to keep it, you can.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
In the cars, too?!
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
'We might as well make the best of it.'
I just got to talk to you for one second.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Can't do it.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Tell me.
We should talk alone.
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
Step into my office.
Thanks, Max.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
But this is a bad one.
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Okay... what about Strickland?
What do you mean?
Only way I could stand your ties.
You bet.  Did you like it?
I won't say anything.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Who was just here?
She never gave me a tape.
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
Your sex life?
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Yeah, but that was for love.
Coming with you.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Wants to share.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
So that gives you something.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
So the guy's not a sicko.
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Are you going to make me beg?
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Aw, Mom!
You really want that on your head?
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
You're thinking...?
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
What?
Winona.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
What kind?
What about his killer?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
"Was?"
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
How long ago?
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
I understand.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
Not especially.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
This is some serious shit.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
I know.
We did find these, however.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
You did.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
And you're working with him?
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
No weapon.
He's moved on to TV.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
I already have an employer.
Yeah.
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Sounds like fun.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
The same.
I talked to him.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Shuddup.
You're money, baby.
...maybe...
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Nikki.
Hi.
Just like that?
How was it hard?
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Anything.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
...And she's with someone else.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
No...
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Six years.
I would love to see you again sometime.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
...get the hell outta here already...
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
...Six months.
Why didn't you call?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
It sucks.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Classy.
Bud.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
I'll be your winger.
Well, that's dumb.
I didn't make it...
Sure.
I can't believe you.
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
She's really special, guys.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
I don't know...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
She smiled baby.
I know, but...
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Yea, how much?
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
Yes!
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
Yeah.
Aww... He got away?
...It looked money.
Minnie Pearl.
What?
What a surprise.
We're not messing with you...
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
...It's on.
No.
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
You think?
True.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...Yeah.
...it is so on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
You don't have to wait three days...
Barzini.
Ba Fa Goulle.
Like hell I will.
Understood.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
Sure.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
Should I bring him in.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Barzini.
Then why have I become a man like you?
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
How do you know I come from America?
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
Okay.  One minute.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
They're waiting to see my father.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Yes.  Tell me.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Michael, I love you.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Oh Michael.
Let HER ask.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
The kid's right.
Probably a year...
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
What are you doing in Mongi?
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
It's vile.
No, I like him.
I don't like you.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Okay.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
That's funny.
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
No!
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
What?
Oh God, I don't think so.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
It's Freddie. Let me in.
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
Have you done something to your hair?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
I'm sure we've met.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
I hope she never knows.
Bird. That's jazz.
Sure.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Where's Dickie?
Ha. Did he say why?
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Dickie did it.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
To the manner born.
He's having an early night.
What?
I can explain.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Why? When?
I don't believe a single word you've said.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
As in the...?
Is Freddie in Rome?
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
I'll take them both.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
Where have you been since then?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
It's okay.
He says so many fiances.
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
I'll fix some drinks.
What do you want to change about this moment?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Well that would be even better gossip.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
Peter, I... I...
Of course. What happened to your face?
Even your fiance...?
What about Thomas Ripley?
31 people.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
You have, yes.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
Who mam?
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
What's wrong?
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Yeah.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
You forgot "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
More people watch it.
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
You sure he's not Italian?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
With the other hand, right?
What is it? I'm busy.
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
Easy.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Do I look like a narc?
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Yes.
Physical? Criminal?
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
Well then check back tomorrow.
Why do you ask?
Why?
Oh?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
Yeah?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
I know.
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
It's all I could think of.
It's about time.
Partners.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Hi.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
I am, too.
Okay.  What's the second thing?
... including me.  Right?  
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
And why not?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
Nothing.  
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Exactly.  And he got good.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Yes.
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
I do.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
I... I need a drink of water.
Well, son, you're home!
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
Harry, son.  Harry.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
... Ernie.
Yes?
They're...
The film broke...
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
The G-man?
Pete...
No, sir.
I guess I did.
Thanks.
She's very pretty.
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Aren't you coming?
Can we get him to the hospital?
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
I... I don't believe this.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
Yeah, well, that's enough.
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
What?
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
No. Just a few hours.
Yes.
Thank you.
If you have some, I'd...
When was this?
A trifle.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Look.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Just listen to them!
If your father were here...
Darling, of course I do!
I don't know yet.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Is she all right?
Try my best.
Yep.
Yep.
Right across the bay there.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
What name?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
What happened?
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
I'm simply quoting the law.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
That's a chance we have to take.
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
If they are?
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I don't mind, really.
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
What?
Aren't these lovebirds?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
We met in court.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
What for?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Yes.
It is for me.
Yes.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Don't let's take any chances.
The bay doesn't.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
Inland.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
How soon?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
To...  To kill them.
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
With smoke.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
Then let's go. Now!
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
Ask this one favor --
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
Excuse me.
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
I can't believe that.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
It was a woman when we put her in.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
I can't.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
Burke them?
I come from Lisbon.
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
He must leave me alone.
Where are they?
Where are they? Last chance.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Keep that thing away from me.
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I know her friends.
Someone else did it.
I told you, I knew your sister.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
Yeah, we do.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
Watch out!
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
It's not what you think.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
He'll be there at 8:30.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
Yes -- that is true.
That's what I came to see you about.
I leave that in your hands.
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
That can easily be arranged.
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Yes, I have!
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Where is that?
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
I can judge only by what I see.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
What about him?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
Is that what you're thinking about?
I feel different right now.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
Would you like to sell it?
That's right.
You don't.
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
This one could save your life.
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
Can't stand light?
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
We don't ride with vampires.
You gotta drive!
El Vampiro.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Why?  They're only noodles.
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
Yeah.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
How do you know they're not?
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
I thought we were goin' into town.
Did we have a date tonight?
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
No.  I'm up.
Okay.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
I thought we were poor.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
Okay.  Talk.
What do you mean?
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Okay.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
Save Laddie first.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
No.  Why?
No.  On the phone.
Don't turn on the light.
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
I don't know.
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
Let's load 'em.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
So what's our problem?
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Hell no.
Cut him loose?
What?
We ain't buying that.
Then I'll have to kill you.
What do you mean "you think so?"
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
Damn you, MacReady!
Nothing we can do about that.
After all this mess.
How far's that?
That far?
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
Damn if I won't.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Little over two hours.
Can you think of any other tests?
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
MacReady, that you?
It's the generator I think!  No power.
What?!
And everyone looks like us?
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
What kind of stories?
What are you?
What?
Yes.
Alexander.
Created?
How do you control the Morlocks?
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
Sorry... I was distracted.
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
Not here... alone.  Please.
No... let's walk through the city.
It's only a machine.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
I'm glad.
Thank you...
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Yes...
Mm.
Your husband is dead?
I can see Kalen's point.
It must have been safe.
Orion's belt...
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
May I get you some --
Exactly correct, sir.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Do they?
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
I did...
Why?
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
Dean Fulton...
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
What's it like where you come from?
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
What about Starks?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
In where?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
My business?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
[Beat] What?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
Yeah.
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
Yes.
It's Sunday.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Why?
Where are you going?
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Why "of course"?
I'll manage.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Uh-huh.
What?!
See ya.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
You girls are in some hot water.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
Tell us about him.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
A .38.
Oh, definitely.
What's wrong?
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Thelma?  It's me.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Maybe.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Yes.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Isn't this fun?
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Ready when you are.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Which part?
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Give me the keys.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
She thinks he's a pig.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Taking a shower.
What happened?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Try to.
What for?
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Alright, Louise!
What.
You know those little dogs you see people with?
I can see that.
I believe you.
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
Yes, Thelma?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
Eeuww.
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
We can change our names.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
Yup.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
You, too, sweetie, the best.
You got that right.
Grrrreat!
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
So you admit it?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
He implied it.
Good-looking?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Uh-huh.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Huh.
Jesus Christ you're right.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Out getting coffee.
Who?
Call you back.
No I can't.
Am I?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Yep.
Dumbshit.
Some buildings I'm working on.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
That...? Vestibule.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
You're a movie buff?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Uh-huh.
Well, I know you're busy...
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
So she's married?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Good good.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Your turn?
Same here.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
You mean him.
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
No I'm not.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Puffy, get over here.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Where would I have seen your work?
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
Huh?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
He's dead.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Hi, Ted.
Hm?
Oh great, I ran out.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
Trying to be.
You're Woogie?
Shhhhhh!
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
What are you doing?
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Yes.
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
What if I can't?
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Forget it, Scotty.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
Oh, yeah -- right.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Seven.
Ray.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
Watch out!
You've got no jurisdiction.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
He said he doesn't know.
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
I don't see the connection.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Crow Horse, listen --
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
How the hell do you know?
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
And far too aggressive.
Um. You.
The what?
What are you talking about?
Uh hum.

You're an animal.
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
About as much as they think about killing me.
Are you really that brave?
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
I'm fine.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
Not to me.
I like to play "reality".
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
Who's gonna win?
No sir! But you have to be ready.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
These guys are getting on my nerves.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
What is?
What?  What is it?
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
Saving them some paperwork.
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
280, 290, 300 knots.
Any more MiGs?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
Who's your pilot?
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Right.
Come on, relax...
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
I want him!
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
They should have warned you about that one.
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
GOT 'EM.
SHIT!!
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
We did it.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Didn't everybody?
Bad?
How's it goin', Coog?
Me?
Sir?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Is that how you remember it?
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Or....
I don't know...
I never heard that.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
What was that?  An accident?
But maybe you can change all that.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Thank you.
Get it, please.
Fuck you.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
So why am I still alive?
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
I know that.
Don't be an idiot.
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
Sleazy...and demure.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Where?
Relax, you'll live longer.
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
Harry!
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Split up.  Find him.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Just think about it.
Bye.
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
Beats me.  I just work here.
I'm here at Rekall.
Doug, don't!
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
Jump!
I used to model for 'em, why?
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
You two-faced-bastard.
I gave you?
What?
No problem.
Cannon fuse.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Well, who put you two in charge?
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Nope, there!  That's one.
Howdy, Rhonda.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
I think we wait right here.
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Me, too.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Civil?  I'm civil.
What?
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah, Val.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
Yeah, geography.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
Correct.
Absolutely.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
Let go of my hair.
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
No. No...
I specialize, Roger...
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
Chinatown street gang.
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
You really think that's what happened?
What, the lunatic who --
-- You found his mugshot?
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
1530 Rivington Street.
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
See-cil.
Don Reynard.
This and that.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
-- Every word.
-- What trial?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
For control of the prison drug trade?
Yeah, we do some of that.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
I want you to kill for me.
Get lost Bobby.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Thank you, Carl.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Yep, it sure is.
Was there an argument?
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
Teresa Banks.
No, sir, we did not.
Where's Hap?
Sorry to hear it.
Did she ever mention any friends?
How come Jack let's you work here?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
I don't know, Sam.
It's late, Sam.
I think that's a good idea.
She's wearing a ring.
You didn't do your homework?
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Maybe.
Well, why not?
Donna, are you my best friend?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
What can I tell you?
I did? I didn't see anything.
What does Bob say?
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
I already made you two tapes.
What? She asked about my father?
Let's go all the way.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
You mean the ones you pity.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
What?
They were looking for wood.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
Sure you do, it's good for you.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Good night, sweetheart.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
Dad...
A friend from school.
Oh, Leland.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
As if I didn't know.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
The man's an ambulance chaser...
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
How did you settle on the amount?
You thought it was just.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Gruber...
It looks that way.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
I...
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I'm just an M.D.
I know of him.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Yes!
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
It was good of you to meet...
Well...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
...and you're going to do that?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Hi. How are you doing?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
And are they going to get it?
You're talking like a drunk.
I... do you want me to leave?
If I don't 'grow up...'
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
Missus...
Nothing happened.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
...I know. I went...
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
That's for sure, Frank.
...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
I'm going to help her.
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
Admittance form is wrong.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Yeah.
Read me what she said.
...one of the other nurses?
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
The Big Boy did...?
Come on out!  We're friends!
All right - I've seen enough!
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
It was nearer than that.
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Sort of a trial balloon.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
No biggie, really.
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
You get any sleep last night?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Chase, it's Dylan!
Like what?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
Absolutely.
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
Everything is not fine!
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
Home, that's right.
Coming for you...
Read me some?
I'm fine.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
Yes?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Listen, dammit.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
They wouldn't let me...
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Do you let your child watch your movies?
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
You miss him.
We were idealists.
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Yes sir.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
I just can't believe it.
What?
Figured what out?
That's not why he's sending me.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
I know enough.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
Forget it.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Who?
I can't make it out?
What are you talking about.
It was my fault.  I slipped.
He killed the dolphin.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
No.
No.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
He's a big boy.
And, of course, we are.
You do?
You're officer of the watch, George.
What's that?
That's enough.
Why would you do that?
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Shut up donut.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
What is it... the secret?
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
What?
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
Long enough.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
What?
I'm sorry...
He climbed when he was ready.
Yes, I was.
... Absolutely not.
Why? He's right in the groove.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
We don't have no paper bags.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Well... Yeah - okay.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
You an indian?
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
That's right... Take one of these.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Thanks.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Muchas gracias.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
Hasta siempre.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
What's that, peanut?
What's that?
You up for that?
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Got anyplace special in mind?
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
It's just another case, Sailor.
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
I'm goin'.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
That'd be good, Lula.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
I'm afraid she is, baby.
Yeah?
The only one.
Oughta make 'em happy.
Uh-huh?
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
What could I be up to, Lula?
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Got any plans?
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Yes.
Someone's gonna see us.
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
You heard right.
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
The candelabras were my Gran's.
So I hear.
He's right, you look horrible.
You're welcome.
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Shut up and drink.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
He heard everything we were saying.
Where would we go?
Shit.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Maybe... I don't know.
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
Call it a hunch.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
It's mine.
And your wife left you.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
With Emily?
Yea?
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
I'll miss my bus.
Like the lady herself.
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
You?
What's he saying?
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
Sure.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
Yeah, well, actually...
Your aunt?
Where's that?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
That's right. That one.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
I never said that.
No thanks.
When nobody's looking.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Do?
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
It beats 'What's your major?'
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
That good, huh?
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
Over there. In the backseat of the...
Are you sure you parked it there?
And you're old.
Oh?
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Taking the long way home.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Give me a break, Grady.
A jockey? You mean, like --
The perpetrator.
Just a few then. The big ones.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
You want to keep him happy.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
Huh?
It's a nice table.
It was a beautiful present.
No thanks.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
Sure.
I mean... feelings.
The mother sure has her hands full.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
That was terrific.
You live around here?
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
I have friends.
I'm not pretty.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Got something to hide?
I could get a search warrant.
Okay.
I fell asleep.
Yes.
Little Red Riding Hood.
Know what?
I was asleep.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
You are in.
Lovers' quarrel?
Yes?
Are you sure?
Ms. Kramer.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
I don't feel anything.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
I'm not that crazy.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Sorry.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I see my sister.
In my bed too.
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
This is garbage!
What picture?
People without cars.
I thought you were a dyke.
What do you think?
I'll buy a plant.
What?
Yeah?
I get that impression.
Not tonight.
I suffer from insomnia.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
Hi.
The worst?
Yeah.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
What did you do to them?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Walter.
You don't really --
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Which brother did this?
Maybe you should be.
Live together.
Just think about it.
Fine.
Nothing.
Not when they fly.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Yeah.  So sue me.
They'll come out after us.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
God, I hate that bitch.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
You watch yourself.
Missed what?
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
How deep?
Check this out.
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
Wait for what?
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
This one is gorgeous.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
Well, what?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
Maybe you'd better ask him.
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
Yes.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Are you joking?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Okay. In a few minutes.
Nothing.
Why?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Late, very late.
It was futile. We went all over.
But then why did you bother changing?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
What do you mean by sensible?
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
It couldn't be any clearer.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
We'll try again.
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
Ask her.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Here I am.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
And do you remember where she got off?
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
What boat?
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
I don't see why I should mind.
They didn't seem too good.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Lady Patrizia!
Is that possible?
Is that far from here?
You really must do me this one favor.
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
Who?
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
It's not my time of month.
Yes.
Oh, there are so many.
Why should they?
Where?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Not at the moment, no.
I've stopped menstruating
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
I'm always bad.
I breathed!
No...
She watches... she listens.
... makes me...
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Her headaches.
Yes I am.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Because I was afraid.
Yes.
I'm afraid.
Someone's following me.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
What do you do?
Yes.
Yes.
What did she mean?
Agnes... Agnes...
Agnes who did you see?
Of course you do. Who was it?
Yes.
Agnes, who did this to you?
Sister...
Thanks...
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Who are you?
What business is it of yours..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
I haven't a clue.
None as far as I know.
Yes, but I...
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
That's ridiculous...
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
And in your eyes?
That possibility never occurred to you?
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
Then help her.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Answers.
Nothing.
Yes.
About what?
Yes.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Bullshit!
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Long, thin and filtered.
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
Begin what?
You're what?
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
You're saying God did it?
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Is it because she's a nun?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
I left it with her and I went for help.
Wasn't it!
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Are you now?
What they like?
How about Ding Dong?
Read 'em!
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
Yeah.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Spoil sport!
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
Yeah, grotesque.
Well, what happened?
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
How'd you guess?
Is it ... is it, really?
Something like that.
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
I'm not wrong.
Me!
Oh, they seem all right to me.
Hello.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Don't dramatise.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
That's all right then.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Hiding.
He's got you worried, then?
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
He started it.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Ah, go on, you swine.
Well you're not going.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
What?
I knew I could rely on you.
Oh, leave off!!!
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Y'what?
Don't exaggerate.
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
Sorry.
Someone put it on me.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn't got any.
Clever.  George.
Shurrup, cheerful.
Yeah, it's you all right.
Hell, we're equipped --
Kill drive engines.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
... I don't know...
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Is it solid?
Looks like a derelict.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
What is it, I can't --
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
God I'm hungry.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
Shit...
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
That way.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Is it alive?
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
Well we better do something.
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
Careful, don't get under it!
I'll come with you.
Can you do anything for him?
How do we locate the creature?
Oh my God.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Hey!  what about the film?
We sure need this flamethrower.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
Thanks for the thought. 
Feast your eyes.
You lead.
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Yes, thank heaven.
Is it still dripping?
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Found what?
What killed it?
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Even simple.
Food-storage room!
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
Let's be democratic.
What's that supposed to mean?
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
I'll get you out of there.
What can I do?
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Wait a minute.
Thanks.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Better tell the boss.
What's happening?
No, but I got something that might interest you.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Yeah?
I dunno.
What?
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
How?
Okay.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Real man' drink.
Want some?
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
You should hit the sack, too.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
Yes. The Shubert.
I believe I will.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
D-day.
Frankly - yes.
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
No-no-no...
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
That's how you met me. In passing.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Eve! My understudy...
Of course I knew.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
How nice.
Huh?
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
That I am...
When - when are you coming back?
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
I love you...
What?
See you...
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
I don't think that's funny!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
Here we go...
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
I'll say.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
I just wondered.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Also Addison deWitt.
You didn't have to tell me.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
Are you proud of me, Bill?
I'm for it.
You're quite a girl.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
But she just got here...
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
Buy some.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
Behind in your dues? How much?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
No.
Don't be dense. The party.
I might.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
You rest. I'll get it...
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Try...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
No, Eve, I won't forget...
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
I'm not crying.
I'll never get over it.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
Over my dead body...
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Not at all...
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
There are other plays...
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
I had no idea you knew each other.
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
With tears.
In a minute...
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
What is?
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Eve?
I wonder why.
That's quite a change of subject.
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
With gestures, of course.
Now just a minute-
I'm a human being, I've got some!
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
How do you mean?
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
You'd have been proud of her.
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
Too bad.
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
You know, she probably means well, after all...
I just played it.
How about me what?
A couple of weeks.
Would you?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
I was sure trying.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
Facts or theory?
Go on, go on--
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
--Colson.
--shit--
--has he got an ax?--
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
Night.
--Teddy Kennedy?
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
I didn't.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--that was awhile ago--
And?--
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
--what?--
--there's nothing new in it--
There's always a later plane.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
Just let me get a match.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
How senior?
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--I'm not here.
Look, I told you inside--
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
...check...?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Ratfucking.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Good God!
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
The C.I.A.
I think so.
Nobody ever had too much.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
Absolutely.
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
Sorry.
You need some work, buddy!
...okay...
I'm not good in math.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Uh-huh.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
What?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
Yeah right.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
What?
You mean...and orgasm?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
Uh...
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
Pontificated.
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
He's going in!
Holy shit!
She's already on a plane back home.
You fuckin' rule!
I'm not going.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Michelle.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Me?
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Oh no.
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
God dammit, Stifler!
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
I want to hear you say it.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
What?!  How do I do that?
Qualify for what?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Stifler!!
Dude, he does not.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Thanks.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Are you okay?
A cure?
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
Yeah. French fries...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
Where?
Andy...
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
You'll never get the chance.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Why isn't it doing anything!?
Looks like he lied to you too.
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
Andy? Andy is that you?
Sort of...
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
How well did, er, do you know him?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
You fucking liar!
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
I know, but I had to because . . .
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
I'm not sure but look. . .
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Yes, your highness.
What happened to your parents?
You shouldn't have pushed us!
Sad?
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
I'm glad you	did too.
Is it? Is this what you want?
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
Yes, you do. You do.
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Rasputin!
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Promise me she'll have her home.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Yes.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Well, why not?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Okay, that's good.
I'll getcha a piece.
Nice car.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Neat, yeah.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Really?
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Of course.
I have a tiny apartment.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
U-huh.
Let's just do it, all right?
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Are yuh?
Following is different. I was spying.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
M'm.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
What thing?
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Nothing at all?
Remember that day?
Thanks, honey.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Yeah.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Oswald and ghosts.
You catch Dylan?
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
What are you depressed about?
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
M'hm.
V.P.L.?
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
Yeah. Right.
She was stealing.
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
A long time.
Why didn't you come in?
You're fucking desperate.
Absolutely not.
She's got great tits.
Not this time.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
Didn't I say?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
She's in ICU.
She left a note.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Not as a rule.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
There's still time to undo this.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Did he promise?
Beats a lawsuit.
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
No.  I missed that.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
Really?
I'll say as little as possible.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
It's taken care of.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Love?
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
This is insanity.  Sally...
What?!  You aborted our child?!
Everybody hates the messenger.
I'll be with you.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Ah there's our snookums now.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Time!
Yes.
God willing.
Why?
Oh?
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
How long ago was it?
Not at all.
Oh?
Really??
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
What does that mean?
I'm worried about your Galiano.
That's not an answer, is it?
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Ah.
Would you like to meet my husband?
Hm.
A notch above the storage room.
So how much do you hate her?
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Right...because every ant's important!
Wanna dance?
<u>What</u>?
You -- you think I'm right?
No...as a matter of fact...
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
How should <u>I know</u>?
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Want a list?
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Yes?
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
You held onto this all that time?
There's something going on, Z --
And do Princesses do improper things?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Superior numbers, kid!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Ant Team Six...
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Oh, of course --
Why are we so successful?
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Oh!
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
How is your cold?
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Of course not.
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
No -- I don't want anything.
Someone from the office.
Baxter.
No -- it's my stomach.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Was he really upset when you told him?
You really think so?
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
You did?
No, I don't.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
You usually eat alone?
What?
Fine. How's your eye?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
I'm fine.
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
Shut up and deal!
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
You better.
Swap them? For what?
Yes, of course.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Yes, sir.
I got kicked in the head, too.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Oh, I'm very grateful.
What do you want?
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Now will you get out?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Me?
Let me get my bag.
It's regulations.
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Happy New Year.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
Not particularly.
Who?
I took sleeping pills.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Important?
We talked about a lot of things.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You know I do.
Stop that, Fran.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Atlantic City?
He wouldn't.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
What gives?
Go where?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
Lovely. You were a big help.
It won't happen again.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
It's a thought.
Yeah --
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
Sure, thanks.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
I don't believe you --
Looks that way.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Not a thing.
... he's an amazing officer.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
Who knows what's up there?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Which way? Right or left?
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Would he remember you ?
We ain't goin' down the river.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
Well, he's killing now.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
What about an American named Kurtz?
I haven't surfed since I got here.
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
Six to eight feet.
Wh -- what?
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Haiphong.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
When did you hear?
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
I met him.
Yes, I know.
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
We'll exterminate the fuckers !
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'm taking you back.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
His name is...
I should be checking on the boat.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What did you hear?
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
Right now -- I am.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
23   CONTINUED:  
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
168  CONTINUED:
Keep back.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
I don't want to talk any more.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
-- Corbett's a killer.
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
Wait a second.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
I'll tell you everything later.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
You know Meyerling?
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
How many do you see?
Where's my ELT?
You got one?
You don't know how true that is.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Shut up!
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
What does this matter to you?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
We were just talking about him.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
His home number.
Okay.
I see the help -- judgement call.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
What are you doing here?
My son is sick, okay?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Thank you.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
Two days.
Is there another way to see it?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Nonsense!
Fries.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
To hell with sex.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Okay. Good-bye.
Okay.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
I just love her.  How're you doing?
What are you trying to do to me?
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Two years ago...
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Okay by me.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Thanks.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Never a break. Never.
This stuff is pointless.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
Another place where?
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
I'm coming.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
So you're from around here?
I know you're going to jump.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
What?
Oh, yeah.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
You're too late.
What?
Sure.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
I know.  It was a joke.
I bet you fucking know!
Yeah?
Yeah.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Just Electra?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Why?
You went from high school to the Agency?
They tried to kill you?
Yes.
Nothing.
Why not?
Yes.
No.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Here?
Thank you.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
How do you know they're not?
What?
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Why?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
She was taken.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Shit.
Right.
Okay.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Honesty.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
Do you believe that?
Anytime.
It's a common question.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Thought of everything haven't you.
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
They'll never get us.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
We don't speak Czech!
Why don't we go together?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
Tell me some bad news?
That bad?
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
So?
Did you see anything in the files?
What are you talking about?
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
That one?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Doug?
No!
Regards to Her Majesty.
How about you Brutus?
What?
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
Thanks.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Great....How long will it go for?
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
What is bail?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
Thanks.
Guests.
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
No way, he even gave me back pay.
What for?
Why?
Go to hell!
You bastard!
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
We're not sure...
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Some Americans?
Heart be still.
I'll tell her you were here.
I'm sorry about how we --
And I have no idea why.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
That's over. Way over.
He wants to show now.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
You do --
Demented.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Me.
-- This your idea of small talk?
'They won't.'
-- Your act only works with an audience.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Why?
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
And you have to meet my father.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Looking for something -- someone.
In 76 years, me neither.
I'm really glad you think so.
It's not.
And why would that scare me?
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
I wanted this to be a date.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
Fun.
Where?
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
I don't care.
That what you do?
Anything you want.
I'm not going back to school.
He wants help with his lines --
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
How -- how long does she have?
I'm not tired.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
Please.
Where did you get -- ?
I didn't say you did.
You came here to give me my report card?
Uh, yes, sir...
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Seventeen.
Poly-what?
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
Good.
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Well... yeah...
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
Home, school, here... 
Pro! Release the rope!
AM or PM?
Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
Precisely! 
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
So what? We'd be rich!
Ssshhhhh!
Marty.
Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
You were ringing the doorbell!
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Jesus!
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
The Orpheum.
Dick? Dick who?
Okay.
No, he showed me one.
Okay.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
They're okay.
Thanks.
What's your friend's name?
Holly.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Sure.
He'll say that?
I don't know.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
I don't care.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
How bad off is he?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
How's he doing?
Just looking.
I don't want a steak.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
How about over here?
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Yeah.
Really?
No.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Who're you?
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Vanished. Thin air.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
It?  Who does?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
The door's locked.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Everybody okay up here?
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
A what?
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Flying to Cambodia.
How about you? Will you be alright?
Please, Barton.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
Really?...
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
You wrote his scripts for him?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
I want to know!
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
A week, eight, nine days 
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
He's a great writer 
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
To do what?
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Hell, I could tell you some stories
And I could tell you some stories 
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet  what happened to your ear?
Nope.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor  though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong  Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Seems like nothing but, lately.
Charlie, I'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  I've gotta call the police...
You gotta believe me 
We gotta call the police 
Yeah.
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to 
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy  like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
Huh?
What 
The others are being sent.
No kidding, bright boy  we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
...Fred...
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
Yeah.
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
She was there, wasn't she?
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
It's been three months.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
She said what you said she'd say.
No, Nick, please --
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
Only when they make interesting reading.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
Thanks.
Why not?
Fine.
What if I call you Nicky?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
What's it about?
To see if he can get away with it.
To see if I can get away with it.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
Did you like her to watch?
No.
When?
You paid $50,000 for your character?
No.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
It won't sell.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Why would I need an attorney?
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
I got tired of being played with.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
I know what that's like.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
I don't believe it.
You're my friend, Gus.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
I'm going with you.
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
Fuck you, too Nick.
It was an accident.
On what basis?
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Not sure. How was yours?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
I think it's in New Jersey.
Ignorant art?
Well, have you asked her to come back?
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
No.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Sure.
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
Sure, ok..
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
Decipher?
They're just words.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Out?
What's wrong with you today?
SAMO.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
For real?
Can I walk you home?
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You don't have any fucking money..
Think so?
Hi.
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
Stand still.
Wanna Mac?
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
What time is it?
I didn't know.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Yes and no...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Nope, I told her everything.
Photojournalist.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
Actually, it's a lot like that.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Yes?
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
Right here, sir.
That, sir, does not compute.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Oxbridge Academy?
I recognized the accent.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
Alfred's happy here.
Divide and conquer.
I didn't kill your wife.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
Mr. Freeze.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
She knows who we are.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
From the other side of the equator-
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
What?
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
But he's never said a word-
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
She wants to kill you.
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
I've got to stop him.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
She has an excellent mind.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
What?
What?
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
What's wrong?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Wait. You can't go.
Banzai.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
Who is it?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
I got family. ...Please.
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Here. Get a good seat.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
Miss.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Take me. Let the boy go.
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
What is it you want?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
... Terror.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
... Where are you calling from?
WHAT?
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Because I want someone I can trust.
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
He's not crazy.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
I said I'd check with you.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Uh ... yes ...
Excuse me.
oh dear.
Isn't it?
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
Yes?
Why thank you sir.
I am sorry you feel that way.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Of course he is.
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
The TV.
Yeah, heh heh.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Uh... Uh...
Me first!
Yeah, really.
My butt's bothering me!
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Cool, huh huh.
Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!
Butt-snatch...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Where are his pants?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Yup. Huh huh.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
I am sitting.
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
Two hours.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Won't?  Or can't?
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
That's my girl!
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
<u>You</u> left me.
Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
Wait.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Maybe we should knock first?
... acts like she's thirty-five.
He might have hurt somebody.
3:30 I guess.
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
And live in what, our station wagon?
Are you a spirit too?
I want to get in.
I think so.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Let me have it.
I cannot believe this.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
I thought I saw something.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Attic space.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
Oh, fine.
... Straight out?
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes, I will.
Hardly any, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Thank you.
I agree.
No. It won't do that.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
No. I like it here.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Good night, Eve.
Yes.
... Mentor...?
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
I see.
Hello, Sid.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
I don't want Robert.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
... I see.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Yes. You look very sick.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
Yes, Ben - he is.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
Thank you, Ben.
Yes.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes.
Yes. Of men and women.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Of course. I would like to look.
Yes.
... Yes. You can take me.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
No. I don't object.
Which view?
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
I am a very serious gardener.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
I live here.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
No.
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
... Hello.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Try again.
I said - try again.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
Good evening, Wilson.
Hello, Sophie.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
No problem, Chief.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
No, sir.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Good. Anything else?
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
Yes, I did.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Oh yeah, he's good.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
May 11th.
I... puppeteer.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
We'll talk about it in the car.
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Don't crowd me, Craig.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
Fuck Maxine.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Schwartz.
Yes?
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Yessir.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain doors which should never be opened.
I'm right?
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
What's he been in?
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
Ha ha ha!
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
But I think I have another plan.
Why are you being like this?
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
No you mustn't, my child.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
I have to see you.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
Lotte called me.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
It's okay, my sweet.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
He's a selfish bastard.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Was a time I knew what was.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
You remember Halle.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Yes sir
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Oh.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am.
In case of what?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Extra?
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Oh I been out.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
I don't know him that well.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
You was friends.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
Yeah. Look bad?
She left me. She's gone again.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
What do you think?
It's the LeBaron.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Huh.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
I'm going home, Donny.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Uh-huh.
He's handicapped, huh?
...Also, my rug was stolen.
Far from it.
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Oh?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
What?
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Huh?
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
No, you're not wrong--
What if it's during a game?
Huh?
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
It's your roll--
What the fuck is going on there?
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Now Dude--
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Huh?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
The bulk of the series.
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
Is the car out front yours?
Dude?
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
Come on, Walter!.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Walter--
Dude, I'm sorry--
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Did I urinate on your rug?
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
I said out.  Now.
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
A world of pain.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
He's half yours, partner.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
The House of Pain.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Fry 'em.
I don't think so.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
I don't understand.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Then who does he work for?
Blood...
So?
Thought you were dead.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
He was here.  Watching us.
Not that I'm in contact with.
Us?  What are you talking about?
Don't even start, old man.
But I just got here --
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
He didn't. Get over it.
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
What do you see here?
How can you tell?
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like me.
Blade --
For your miracle cure?
Cancer.
I'm not leaving without you.
For them. But for me --
You're a week early.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
No problem.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
Join the club.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
--Christ almighty--
Not the only things missing, Nick.
There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
I haven't killed any--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
--fine, later, fine.
I don't know. Nightmare.
Sleep.
No.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
Both. Now.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
Turn the tapes back on.
--which'd be about ten bucks--
What?
--Cotter: shut up.
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
Don't have one.
--I don't know.
--who?
--turn the camera off--
Fine.
This isn't about us.
Look over there.
--now there.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Asleep--
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
What're you nuts--
Ah, Domini?
--and we brought it back with us!
--no.
Then I have no idea.
Still working on it.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
I'm sorry.
Shoot.
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
Anna--
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Yes.
I am?
It won't?
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
Your husband.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
Yeah? What happened?
...You ever get tired?
With your gun?...
About ten years.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
...Friday?
Uh-huh.
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
See, I never knew that.
No.
Back where?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
What do you mean...
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
For the money.
I want you to go fishing.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Ya catch any fish?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Has Ray come in yet?
What.
Right.
What's the point?
For what?
What's that?
Tuesday.
I'm not sick.
Okay honey.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
You want to see him too, right?
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Yeah.
Jeffrey.
Never before this.
No. Come on.
See my nipples?
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Do you know?
Yeah. hurry up though.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
. same here.
Frank? .can you stand up?
Please. please stay.
Sure I do.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Yes.
Frank would open you.
Kiss me.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Yes.
Okay Frank.
There ya go.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Terrible. boring.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Alright.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yeah.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I'll drink to that.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Yes.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Goodnight.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey?. Why?
You like mysteries that much?
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
I can't dance fast.
Let's wait for some slow one.
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Do you want the car?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
Derek!
Are you kidding?
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
What?  Yeah, sure.
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Not really, no.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Because they caught me?
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
I just got released five minutes ago.
Okay.
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Yeah.  You do the talking.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
You fucked me, Diego.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
Mom.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Power?
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
And Diego?
Yeah.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I'm going to California.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
Tough spot.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Dad.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
That was a beautiful message.
What do you guys want?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
I said, I've seen it before.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Better than you.
What's happening to us?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
How are you doing?
You can call me Dad if you want.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
I'll be here.
Who's the co-pilot?
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
Dien Bien Phu?
Sail.
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
Sure. By shooting at me.
I don't even know your name yet ...
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Let's try ...
It's a question of habit ...
I think it'll be a success ...
Why?
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
Yes ... But let me first see you.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
So -- where do we start?
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
How?
The official cause?
But there's more?
Yes.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Yes.
Increase his heart rate.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
No -- never.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
Aren't they all?
Back off, John.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
That's enough.
No.
No.
Chinese peony root.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
Then -- those are not your own words?
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Yes.
We dated for about a month last year.
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
He video taped you.
Yes.
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
No.
Why'd you come here?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
We're not animals.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
What would?
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Are you scared?
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
No -- you're not.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Why?
Yeah.
No, Your Honor.
Mr. Roston?
I'm always open to learning new things.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
No.
Why didn't you come to me?
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
Mom's orders.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
I never knew that.
Did we want to?
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Oh! You caught me.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Sure.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
No, your kids.
Clean?
And clean.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
You want to go back in?
No. I'll do them later.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
No. I was just... No.
Wonderful. Uh...
I want you to come.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Sure.
How about Bari?
Have you ever been to that station?
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
I had a temper.
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
But now that you have it -
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
I'm going to miss you.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
I don't remember!
They're not going to find her!
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Then what do you care?
How the hell should I know?
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Go for it.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Just try it.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
What?
Hush, baby.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
How did you get in here?
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
I have to finish this for class.
You mean as opposed to your life?
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
Who?
Mother!  No.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
You moved into this block?
I manage them.
That place is already bad luck.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Bill!  Bill?!
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Dad?
I didn't sell it.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Now you.
Shit, that was fast.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
Should I?
Know what?
Where's what?
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
All part of the business.
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
What are you going to do with it?
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Caesar, maybe we should run --
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
The hell I can't!
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Where, then?
Don't tell him --
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
You betrayed me!
Shut up!
I'm listening.
Five.
Lick me.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Where in the hell is he?
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
...  thank you.
Thanks.
Sure.
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Maybe.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
...  yes.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
What was it then?
What about that guy this morning?
Mickey?
Do you think you know me like that?
Johnnie?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
...  shit.
Yeah.
Yeah, twice.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Thank you.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Hey.
No.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Caesar wants me to stay.
Violet?
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
You're asking me a direct question?
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
So it's time to go home.
We have to go home, Jason.
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
Yeah, I know...
One moment, sir.
Yes, I'm here...
Yes.  Is he there?
Oh, Jesus... 
Get the fuck away from my car.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
Listen to what you want.
No.
I was shot twice in the back.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Where are we?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
You could do that?
What?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
Think I could rent a scooter?
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
What?
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
Hang on... 
-- I'm on it --
I tried.
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
Where am I?
How did I get here?
No.
I won't forget this.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
... new washer.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
It's reply paid.
You don't have to sing it.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Well, I ...
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
You remember Alison?
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
Not much.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Do you know what you're doing.
Shut up!
Ah.
Oh.
Oh, sorry.
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
What?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
A heavy Christmas present.
Well, terrorists of course.
Who will?
You're joking.
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
It's not our mistake!
Information Retrieval.
Next of kin!
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
What's the matter?
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
A woman eh? I see.
This is your dream girl, is it?
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
No, sir.
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
But ... I called Central Services.
Mary ...
He looks like a cop.
Stressed? He's psycho.
Sleeping in the back.
You're going to live.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Ten-four, hon.
He's going to be all right, right?
What's his name?
Yeah?
I guess there's always a chance.
You never know.
At least he's got people around him.
Yes.
No.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
How long you been doing this?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Because you can barely walk.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
What's wrong.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Crazy fucker.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
That's ridiculous.
You learn that in the army?
You're burned out.
Relax, will you.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
Used to be my partner.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
There are only ten.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
What's wrong with it?
What?
It's not loaded.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.  That's a promotion!
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
Yes.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
I don't like the word gay.
Why do you say that?
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Good night.
Not because you have to.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
They're not that dumb, after all.
Okay, great -- good luck.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
I'm not kidding.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Speaking.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
So I quit.
Move away from me.
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Yes.
Yes?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
That's okay.
Okay.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Fill for a second.
I trust you.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
Hey?
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Well, what is it?
Uh-huh.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Good.  That's it...See you.
Because you're nuts.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Right back to you.
Yes, I'm sorry.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Uh-huh.
Is the manager cooperating?
Here here...
Every word...
Hm...
That means you like me!
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Carla -
What are you trying to say?
Why not?!
Just about anything, Walter.
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Don't ask.
I admit it.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
I know, man.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Enough already about it - get to work!
Well...
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
Well, w-what did you do?
Excuse me I have to make a call...
No...look I'm busy...
Telling you what?
Smack?
You are?
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Turn around!
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Did you like it Mister Brock?
What do you get?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
Then let me give you something then...
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
What's with you?
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Amazing!
Let me in.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Get away from here.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Probably.  What movie is this?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Don't tread on the earth?
Hi, guys.
You were having a nightmare.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
I thought we were meeting here.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
I am so sure.
Buffy.
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Not exactly.
Yeah.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Yeah?
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
I'm going to the senior dance.
Like my homework.
Why don't we see a movie?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I forgot.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
To bring you... your birthright.
In Virginia.
I have to show you.
I have cheerleading squad.
Our purposes.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
As for example, what?
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
They don't even have Dolby.
Thank you very much.
You're having a fling with him?
Oh, baby!
I heard she got straight A's.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Well, I hope so.
Throw it out.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Nice much.
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
Run.
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
No, no, it was great.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
I did.
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
--but you're father's in there!
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
He's a virgin.
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
So...Wanta make love?
You're pulling your hips out.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
What?
I can do that, too.
He looks great, just great!
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
You missed him!
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
Naw...
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Then go.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
My right.
Forget it.
You too...Meat.
Love to--
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
Ain't he warning up?
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
Jim looking for somebody.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
...he did what he was told.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
Philip, if you would rise.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
But what happens when they do find out?
It's a pity in this...
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Yeah.
Hold on a second.
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
I don't know.
Matter of fact...
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
Hey.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
Okay.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
No, I don't wanna come -
Yeah?
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Hey, she came to talk...
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
No, a...
Why?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
I -
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
And they were usually right.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Why is she eight pounds over?
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
Certainly.  Senator.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
What is it?
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
Good luck.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
I don't need one.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
What do you mean?
Yeah.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
And where'd you go?
What'd you have?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Who were you with?
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
You get down here!
But it was just mine.
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
Green?
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
What?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Yeah?
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
Shut your mouth!
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
Well, I've been busy. 
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
I understand.
Please.
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Here we go!
Nicky, I did -
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
I'm over here now.
Oh.
Calm down! Calm down!
What?
How are you?
No problem.
I'll be right out.
Am I right?
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
Oh, come on.
It's all right.
I'll be there.
Yeah?
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You did. You're right.
Is that what you want?
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
What's the matter?
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Okay?
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
You are.
Okay, then.
It means I got the money.
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
He called you right here.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
'Go! Go! Go!'
No, I'm gonna drive.
All right.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Boy, look at this place, huh?
You know why, right?
Why?
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
I took care of everybody.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
Go fuck yourself.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Angelo and Buster.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Fuck you!
You sure?
Mr. Chairman -
I'm sorry.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
You are right. What can I...
Yeah.
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
This looks promising...
You're probably right.
What did you think?
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
I'm sure.
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
We'll hunt him down together...
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
What about "climbing in?"
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
What did you say?
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
I know.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
You've seen me...
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
Men, huh?
What's the good news?
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
But of course you are.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
You going to talk all day?
Where do you think you're going?
Don't you have children?
You could've made me lose my call.
Theo wants to talk again.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
Why would I do that?
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Or relieve me of it later.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
Allow me.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Then hang up!  Do it!
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
Shit!
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Another minute.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I'm trying to.
The one in Brentwood.
The City National on San Vincente.
Don't say that.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Lucky for them they didn't.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
Hand me the phone.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
You knew about me.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Why are we stopping?
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
You're the man with the gun.
Only one way to find out.
That's not good enough.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I don't want it.
Who is this?
Didn't we play this scene before?
Got a phone in that van?
Stay there.
Talk to the man.
I still don't see you.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
I won't let 'em.
Better reassure him.
The fuck I will!
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I thought you'd know me by now.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Who are you?
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
See what, Dil?
An excellent quality.
Saw it, Dil.
You heard me --
Cunt.
Fucking mad!
He wants to know do I mean that.
It's a simple question.
In a way.
What's it to you?
He wants me to perform for him.
You can't leave me then, can you?
No, I didn't --
Where?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Tell me about him.
Did you do that to him?
Yes...
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
You say that like a gentleman.
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
Something I heard someone say once.
All the time.
Never said a truer word.
Do you care, Jimmy?
You mean that?
You think that's wise?
Know what, honey?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
A little.
No. Sit down.
It's a secret.
What?
Yes.
Look on it like a honeymoon.
No! I'm going home...
I was trying to get out of something.
You mean that?
You knew my Jody?
Did you hear me?
He asked me to see were you all right.
Stop it, Dil --
Let me go, Dil
Yes.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Love you, Dil.
Yeah.
Never.
Fergus.
Tell me what she wore.
Don't call me that --
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
That's wise, Tommy.
Do you want some food?
Horny bastard.
Can't.
Suits you.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Peter.
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Would make me feel better about it.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
I understand.
Aye, I do, Peter.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Good. So what do you think?
So, what do I look like?
So I've noticed.
Not in your nature.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
She's not my type.
No.
Absolutely not.
Suppose you could say that.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
And you play cricket?.
The fastest.
How different?
Hurry up, would you?
My special friend.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
I've often wondered how you do it.
Some kinds of women are...
I told you not to talk that way --
Stop it --
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
Got to catch me first --
You didn't?
Nice lady.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
I think that's what you ordered.
How was I leading you on?
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
What about it?
How do you think I got here?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
Well -- come on.
Adam --
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
Can you remember anything at all?
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
No!
You lied to me so many times --
So that was it.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
But I don't have it.
Thanks very much.
But --
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Barely, yes.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
But no one actually saw him die.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Brian.
No.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Okay -- up there.
The view had better be worth it.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Would you like to see my passport?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Reggie -- listen to me --
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Okay.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
No.
Maybe.
I'm scared.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
I don't believe it.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Fiction or non-fiction?
Well!
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
And the last one?
Here's ten.
Not unless we're blind.
I don't know anything.
I don't know.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Is that all? Can I go now?
Up there! I would put it up there!
We won! We won!
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
Why, do you think we're going to?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
How do you shave in there?
How would you like a spanking?
What?
That's all.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
The man you had the fight with.
How do you know what they're doing?
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Because I don't love him.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
The American Embassy.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
What's the matter, chrie?
What?
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
Calm down Brent.
I want you to head right home after school.
How much further?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
You are upset.
No?
Are you sure?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
She's still a virgin.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
I'm sure you should have failed.
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
Does she fuck?
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
OK. increase the peace.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
FINE. Are you?
No.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I did.
I'll think about it.
That's not why we broke up.
This party is sick.
What?
I love you.
Hi princess.
That's what he said.
The library. I'll be fine.
What?
You didn't believe her?
And the police did nothing?
The word is Mob.
Who were they?
I'm worried about someone.
Did you want one?
But you don't really mean it.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Okay, okay.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
No.
That dog was mean before I met him.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
I ain't playin' that.
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.

Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?

...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
...Night Shift, but you might...
Come on, old...

You okay?

Come on.
Okay.
Taking it down the hill.

No!

This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
...or nephew or some good old boy...
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...shit.
...split.
That is loud!  I'm 
I think you oughta cut a...
You all right?

 Okay.
Okay. 

Go, go, go! 

What?
  I've got the real thing!
...they come!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
What?

 
 
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
Let's go!
Look out.

Who drove the ice cream...
Who had to put a gun to your head?
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
Thank you.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
Yeah.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
This country trained me to kill...
Hey!

I did what I could for you...

  Hey, actually...

What the hell's a sage?
...including the permanently extreme.
Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
Is it--?
Any of them Richard Long?
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...destroyer of worlds."
You'll kill us all!
Is this stool taken?
You look good, Richard.
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
Almost quaint.
Forget about him.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
I'll do it.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - NIGHT.
Check it out.
...quick in and out.
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
You know the suspect?
...general store.
 But...
Where's their protective...
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
...though.
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
...-spite the mouth.

It won't be long, gentlemen.

 ...checked. 



Be sure you feed Bosco.
There's something else too.
Kabula's out.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
He was Major Andrew Bryn-...
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
It must've happened right after we left.
After that re-...
Excellent.
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
...and that power...
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
...tunnel!
Do you recognize this young man?
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
I didn't sell the boy any...


The usual.  Doc.
EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Jake, for Christ's sake.
'Course you do, Jake.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
A ruler?
Tell me. What do the police say?
That's too bad.
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
No. She's probably scared to death.
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Oh, my, yes.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Oh they don't?
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
No thanks.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Okay.
I said okay, Jake.
I've been wanting to meet you.
Summer colds are the worst.
Who?
Oh yes.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
No?
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
Didn't you call?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
What pictures?
And why's that?
C'mon I'll show you.
Too late for what?
Matter of fact I do.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
What for?
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
What are you having?
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
I don't want to drop it.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I'll stop by.
He told you?
Why?
Did he know?
You were seeing someone, too.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Oh.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
No.
No, I think I'd remember.
Is that unusual?
They can't be.
Doing what?
Your eye.
You saw my fa... father? When?
You bastard.
You mean she just found out?
Aren't you coming back with me?
What did you do that for?
No...
She's my daughter.
...so that's why you hate him...
Back to Mexico.
Where can we go?
With us.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
You'll find one of those people.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
Hope so. He's working for us.
I cut myself shaving.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Si.
Yeah.
Sure you do.
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
...Yes of course.
But...
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Yeah.
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
But that's what you told your wife.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Well, you never know, do you?
Why'd she run away?
Then why don't you change jobs? 
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Yes. 
What's she like? What's she like?...
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
We'll talk about that later.
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
Somebody stole it.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
I didn't see that.
I can't take shorthand.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Enthusiastic?
Well, well - isn't that nice?
I'm going back there.
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
Yes -
Who said anything about brooms?
Certainly not.
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
Hello, Bernstein.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
I don't my plans myself.
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Yes, Mr. kane.
It isn't finished?
Has he said when he'll finish?
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
Charles.
It can wait.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
What's the matter with you?
You're no Venus de Milo.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
Oh, me -
Susan, I really think -
Susan!
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
Susan, it seems to me -
I'm not sorry.
You can't stop me.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir -
Not my wife - not either of them.
It's been a tough day.
What're you going to do, Charlie?
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Yes?
Good.
Charlie -
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
Brad, you are drunk.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
That's the train with all the lights.
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Good!
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
What did you get?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
You're shittin' me.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
No, don't!
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
How do you know that?
So you're really getting married?
No, you're not really getting married?
How like her.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Jesus, you're caustic.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
Sang.
Who doesn't?
Like what?
What time was this?
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
Yes.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Annoying Customer.
Peptic ulcer.
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
I told him that and he yelled at me.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
I know.
I don't back down.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
It's today.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
I don't want to talk to you.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
And this is what you rented?
I'm happy.
I'm not. She just left.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
Fuck you.
What time did we go to the funeral?
This life.
I should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
Fuck you.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
Jesus.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Thirty-fire.
I know I can bench more than that!
Jesus Christ, what next?
How much can you bench?
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
One seventy-nine.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
Lasagne.
Maybe.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Hunhh? Nothing.
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
How do you figure?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
He gets off on it.
Why do you say that?
That's because I never had sex with him!
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Something like thirty-six.
Um. Thirty-seven.
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
WHAT?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
That's sick, Dante.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
You're not?
He didn't ask me to...
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
I copy.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
Where's the radio?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
You're getting warmer!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
One...
Nice and easy...
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
I don't expect you to understand.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
He can handle it.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
What are you doing here!?
You got to go back now!
You know me, I'm a night person.
What about you?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
This rope is sixty years old!
Never
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
Don't let me fall!
I don't know.  I don't know.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
Forget it!  I refuse!
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
I burned it.
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
Sue me.
There is.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
Anyone else following?
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Ask the questions.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
I've been cured.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Try the wine!
No. She's dead!
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
How do you do, sir?
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
You're gonna be sick are you?
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Fair hair, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
Vitamins will it be then?
But it was horrible.
Yes!!!
Fine. Fine.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Oh.
I just say what the other person would say?
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
You have, my son.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Amen. They cross themselves.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
What?
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Bottega.
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
Jesus...
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
'Fraid so.
Can't say that I do.
Twenty five?
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
So?  It was a random thing.
Elvis?
No harm done, ma'am.
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
Oh.  Sorry.
It's not that kind of job.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Yeah.
Two...
Okay, try it now.
It's a mess.
Who was he?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Yes, Max?
You mind?  I'm working here.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
What difference does it make?
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
I don't get it.
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
No.
You had to kill Heller?!
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
No, not just that.
One more.
That's the reason?
Answer the question.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Let her go.
Who?
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Why the hell not?
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Motive?
I think you're different.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
Switch the charts.
What is?
As opposed to?
Yeah.  I think so.
Surprise me.
I've been reading up on it.
Pretty scary, huh?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
Realized what?
Right here in Manhattan.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
This way.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Without a love of my own.
Top pocket...  Go on.
Now she tells me.
That's great.  Good for you.
Could you be a little more specific?
<u>Liza</u>!
You've never seen her run.
I'm not sure what you mean.
I'm leaning toward no.
I don't know...
A dog bit it.
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
The truth shall make you free.
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Terminal?
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
Yes, that's right.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
I don't understand.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
You don't understand --
No.  Not yet.
What do you mean?
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
What do you suggest?
What?
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
What?  Why?
With me.
Ellie.
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
Put it on speakers.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
Because I can't.
But what do I say?
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
The librarian... or the library...?
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
That's my girl...  Lights.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
That's my girl.  Done.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
The systems integration site.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
Now you know.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
If you came back.
I'm sorry.
-- I don't know --
I can't hear this now --
It was quite a page turner.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Meaning...
But --
I got two years.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
That's good: he earned it.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Ram it in and break it off!
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Git to work!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
Yes, Boss.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
I call.
Get away!
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
That's it. That's the end.
Fifty's a nice round number.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Take it easy, Drag.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Gettin' up, Carr.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Only kidding!
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
Andy?
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
Hal has it.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
When was that?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
What Friday?
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
You come and visit.
Who was the man in the basement?
You're calling me a crank?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
For months... last October.
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
Then what do you need me for?
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
Is there a phone booth there?
What else?
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Because it's your job, that's all.
Oh, I know.
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Honest to God, Ruben!
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
My promise.
What about her arms?
Look at her legs.
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Right.
Yessir.
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
No. But when he's in that car...
I work in the immigration department there.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Yes.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
I did this already.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Please, Letty.
What about the engagement party?
Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
What's the matter?
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
You've only known Jake a few months.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
You too, Mom.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
I've already made arrangements.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
I guess so. I think that's right.
I answered these questions last night.
Very romantic setting.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Good God.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
No rounds for another three hours.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
Lie down.
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
You, too. Kick ass today.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
Are you OK?
The restaurant, too?
I got worried. Are you OK?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
Why'd you tell?
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
What do you want to do?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
No, it's not like that.
Especially this last year.
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
No...
Oh.
I start on Monday.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Sure, I understand.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
What?   This?
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
C'mon, Laurant, America?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I'm not here to negotiate.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
I guess we're going to find out.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
No problem.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
I'm not any closer than you are.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Where are you from?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
Cops?
What about the money?
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
I think he's already figured that out.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
No.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Can I trust you, Sami?
Man, I can get anything.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
It's me.
You said don't do it, boss.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Everything?
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I was told to take what we have and go.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
Me?
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
They sort of got away.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Uh huh.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
I know where she went.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
We don't know that for sure.
The lucky ones.
A little?
A car.
I do as I please.
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
What's it to you?
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
I have a guest.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You're too young to understand.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
How so?
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Come and get it if you can.
Only the sword will settle this.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Yes.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
No onions?
You don't say.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
No.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
Mom tried to cook.
I don't know you.
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
Shelly?
Yes.
Leave me alone -- !
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
You what?
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
That's a matter of opinion.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Please.
What? Another letter from your friend?
Give me the fucking letter.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Who?
Yes.
What?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Wait, don't hang up.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
No.
Not at all. Have a seat.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Yes.
Where are you going?
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Sure.
Yeah, me neither.
What are you saying?
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
I'm sorry about that.
Schwarz. Jewish?
- none taken -
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Do you want to learn or not?
It was nothing.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
I am?
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
You think he'll like it?
I want to go home.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
You promised to let me kiss you.
Is it me?
No.
I know.
You do?
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
I'm working on it.
Okay.
But who will they turn to for help?
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
Yippy.
Take a look for yourself.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
It was... Fantastic.
Mock, mock, mock.
I want to fuck.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
Will you calm down?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Get out!
I'll do my best.
It's Cecile.
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Yes, you already did.
I did?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
What are you talking about?
You bastard!
I'd love to.
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Yes, darling.
At the old house with the voice.
But it's already come true.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
I forgot I had it on.
Yes, darling,
Times have changed.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
What?
Well, you know where it is.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
I'll show you.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
It was just a voice.
Daddy, it's true.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
No.
I'm your friend.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
Oh, please!
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
But she's dead!
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
Wait a minute. Listen.

Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Yeah but they looked cool...
Never felt better.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
What does that have to do with me?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
You're just saying that.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Frida, grab that red one.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
And my bra finally fits again.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
I think he called you beautiful.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
And he was missing an arm.
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
Why not? There's been a murder.
You should have seen it erect.
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
Hide him.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Check out what I found.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
I think I already have.
About Mark? Carlton?
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
Starving.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
So pay them back and apologize.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Yeah?
Did you change your hair?
No?
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
So what book did you buy?
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Oh my god, by wolves?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
A man killed in Central Park.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
No, I got it. It's okay.
No, but thanks for the warning.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
I love you too.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Okay.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
No, take it.
What makes you think I was the last one?
Tell her I'm eating.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
I told you she was innocent.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
What makes her think that?
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
What of?
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
The other one?
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
How will we interrogate them?
Just visiting my patient.
Loose ends?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Yes.  This way.
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
I see...
Patricia Crenshaw.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
Good.
Why are they after you?
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
No.  Have a look.
Wait, this isn't fair...
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Maybe.
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
What the hell is this ?
) Listen, you little...
Great.
Fine.
... What?
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
Fine.
What do you mean, he's clean?
Oh.  Excuse me.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Sort of... Yeah.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
I'm not sure.
Choices?
I'm afraid so.
I see what you mean.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
She knows.
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Fertility beads.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
I had a feeling.
Well...
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
You have a lot of secrets.
I run a temp agency.
You find people jobs?
It was inspirational.
I can't.
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Look.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
Quiet!
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
Ain't no place safe.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
Sir!
In the battle, sir.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Will do.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
I couldn't stop myself.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
I told you, that's a secret.
I'm not?
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
what?!
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
That's not my fault.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
What good will that do?
It's better than doing nothing.
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Meeks.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
YAWP!
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Nothing wrong with research.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
Isn't there an easier way?
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
I'm calling her!
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
Good luck.
I'm sorry, Neil.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Where is this cave he's talking about?
That's miles.
My brother went here.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
Yes.  But
I don't want to read.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
Found what?
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Quiet.  I have to think.
Oh. 
No thanks.
Yea, art thou there?
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
Which question is that?
Who asked any?
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
I have a schedule...
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
You're saying they can think?
A meat locker.
Yeah...
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Joey...
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
Where is everybody?
You want some too?
Nothing.
I know...
Those are mine!
What?
Good... Pass the beer.
Get the boots.
Yeah, Sal--
They did not!
It's Nick!
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
I do!!!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
It won't open.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Yeah.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
You are frightened, no?
Yeah.
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
You know a guy named Merle?
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Nick, she won't say why.
Linda, Linda...!
Would you?
Sure.
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Up north.
I want to go home, Merle.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
We what?
More bullets in the gun?
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
Watch it, shithead!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
That's my plan.
See you Monday.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Yeah.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Yeah!
It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
No.
Sure.
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
Up.
What'cha got, Bennett?
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
What did you say?
Fuck you - fuck you.
Your mother.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Out of the room.
Where?
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
What the hell are you talking about?
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Keep 'em busy.
Relax, let technology do the work.
Drop it.
I was set up.
Yes, sir.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
I'm here.
...What are you talking about...?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
No you don't.
And you should be with your family.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
My granddad was a policeman.
Good to know you, Willy.
No -- that's for me to do.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
Thank you, Belle --
I didn't.
Young man -- you got me there.
And serve him right!
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
Howdy, Hank.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Sure am.
Belle.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Some other time, Stevens.
You are afraid!
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
Well, I'll be -- 
The seventh day of April --
I don't care.
Never!
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
We can still use my butter money.
Not all of it?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Jabez --
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
It don't matter!
I say -- it don't matter.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
You aren't angry with me?
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
I'll do my best, Mary.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
I object.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
You can talk to me ...
Why don't you?
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
That is Christmas music.
I'll find someplace.
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
And if he alters it...?						*
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Only if New Jersey counts.
I told you...
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Roy?
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
How do you know?
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Come on, what's under this?
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
What about the kids?
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
I love you.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
You're really crazy.
Where you gonna go?
I like that... yeah!
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
I'm afraid.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
They're okay.
I'm not alone.
I frisk you?
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
Sonny, come on out!
They were ...
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
What else?
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
We're bringing in your wife...
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
I can take care of that.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
I'll be God damned if you will.
Sure - we like you.
I'm sorry.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
It was on the TV.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Pure?
Yes...
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
All right ... send them the guard.
Yeah ...
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
I said you were never a faggot.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Oh.  Run.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
<i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
That bitch called me a bitch.
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
No. What's the big deal?
...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
In theory.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
We should sign her to a talent holding deal. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- NEXT
Real good.
<i>House is a wreck/ Gotta collect my check/ Gotta perfume my neck/ But keep yo hands off the weave cuz this black bitch don't suck the dick.</i>
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
Have you noticed something about them?
And?
Jade, I still love you.
Ask Sal.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
Is it a good morning?
I've done that before.
That's it?
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
Wake up!
It's gonna be hot today.
What responsibilities?
Stop tripping.
He's just being nice.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
What is?
That's my name.
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
Him no white.  Him no white.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
Gotta go.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Then we'll do something else.
Trust me.
Meda.  Meda.
To get my money.
Later.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
What?
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
I love you.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
Tell Pino.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Whaddup?
Yeah, I think.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Four colors? Neato!
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Yeah, but I'm buying.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
What? No! Look.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
Who's Captain Rob?
LLOYD, she's my mom.
Will not.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Go away, assface.
No. Look.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Do you know what this means?
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Try one in a million!
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I don't know what you're talking about.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
Special Needs class.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
Me too. I'm almost there.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Do we have a deal?
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Who's there?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
Just like the President.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
Love it!
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
We felt his presence.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Yes?... How was your journey?
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
Paul!!  Paul!!
My Lord?
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
Your Reverence.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
They tried and died....  Jessica!
Those sounds could be imitated.
No.
Thank you.
I have no next picture.
I don't understand.
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
That's good.  I could use the money.
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
I never said I could ad-lib...
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Huh?
Don't let me slow you down.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
This is my way of telling you --
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
That's ridiculous.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I told you this was gonna happen.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
Well, uh, if I could I would...
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Hruphh...?
You could say that --
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Are you a fruit?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
I don't think he's a schmuck.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Oh, hi.
What do you mean?
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
STOP!
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Who's Dr. Tom?
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
YES!  JUST DO IT!
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
Yeah. Ma...
Yeah, so... ?
No.
Al!
Went --
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
This is real, Bananahead!
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Mm...  Oh, man...
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
When? Today?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Mm.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
He says --
Oh God. What hospital?
What are you talking about?
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Well, then I'm quitting.
Welcome to work, Ed.
Right.
Okay ...
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Really?
That's lucky.
Why?
... yeah, then, but...
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Come on.
We're excited.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
Please!
Ray, come an--
No. Am I supposed to?
What...
Ed... I'm sorry.
What...
No.
Yeah. Why?
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
pierdes.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
Yeah?
But, Mr. M. -
Ethics are...
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Hello, Tracy.
You will.
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
You're there.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
I know.
For what?
Yeah.
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Paul, get out!
Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
It's Lynn.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
Call me Dudley.
Homicide?  A detective?
Of course... But how?
What work?
Stens?  Was it Stens?
No!  Please leave!
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
What about him?
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
More.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
I don't own no shotguns.
But you were business associates?
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
His blood's always up.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
I'll break them, sir.
And now you'll provide them.
That's right.
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
Just don't shoot me.
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
I want to do it right.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
Why?
Some reality.
Why not?
I know how he feels.
What's Dudley's scheme?
Under the house.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
What's he doing here, Sid?
And Reynolds?
Where'd you hear that?
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
Yeah.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
You're not.
Do it!
Who are they?
You're crazy.
It's a SAT-tracker.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
I called my wife!
Jesus.
Who?
You sure?
Tell me about it.
Listen--
What if--
C'mon.
The thing is...it really can't wait.
What are you saying?
Neil, thank you for your help.
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Yes. I have her permission.
Pardon?
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
The robbery.
A report?
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
No, sir.
Not that I could see.
No.
Just for the criminals.
I see her for business.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Stacy--
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
Just reporters.
What is it?
Yeah.
That's gonna end tonight.
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
It's not?
Oh.
Not that much.
Yes.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
Bullshit.
We're screwed.
How?
Yeah.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
We believe he did.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
--otherwise we may have to--
Shut the fuck up.
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
Seat 74.
Merry Christmas, son.
Fuck off.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Mr. Dean--
Why?
Can I open 'em up?
Alright!
What about jewelry?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Jesus.
Bobby--
Why would they--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Bobby--
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
He got hit by a bus.
You would?
Why not?
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
Yes sir.
What the hell does it mean?
Fuck you.
I said fuck you.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
We found the originals.
Sir--
So they know everything.
We don't know.
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
No.
Yes sir.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
Hello!  Good morning.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
I don't care to bargain.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
I do not.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
No, but I think I do.
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
It's a folk song.
Shall we be all right?
Don't go over it again, please.
Would you let me pass?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
A surprise, he said.
I know.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility
What's the matter with you?
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
No.
I don't know.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
So was my Patient.
So you can shoot a pistol?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
Please don't creep around this house.
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
For?
Is there a song you don't know?
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft
Aren't you?
What?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Never heard of it.

I've done this.  I've had to do this.
This is what I do.  I do this every day.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
I'll always go back to that church.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
I'm feeling old.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
How awful.  What will you do?
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almsy, who doesn't look up from his book.
This was your garden?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
We're getting close.
I'm in the middle.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
It's sold.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Then don't.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
You...you can't.
Well, no...but...
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Not a word.
Give him the card.
Can you follow simple directions?
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
We go underwater?
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
That's because I wanted them to!
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
It was perfect.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
Let's just see how we do.
It was a long time ago.
Charged?
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
Little celebration before we set off.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
In eye of that painting.
It's a party.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
The Mask.
What?
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
Hold the record. Alone.
Everything.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
My job, my rules.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
Like a woman of mystery.
It was wrong to deceive you.
Have really held you under?
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
They drive so recklessly there.
What about you?
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
It better be worth it for me.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
Remind me why.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Probably not.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
All of 'em?
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Yes?
You're a lawyer?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
Right.
I'll say.  Holy moley.
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
Excuse me?
I guess I'm not the right kind.
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
Course I did.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
What, you think I'm made of money?
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
That's crazy -- why not?
I know how DNA works, Erin --
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
They skipped that step.
What?  Who?
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
You're not gonna be there.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
Take it.
Yesterday.
Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Right.
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
I guess I did.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Have you been to the water board?
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
It happens all the time.
In the conference --
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
You got a little girl?
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Why not?
How?
Thanks for reminding me.
What?  But you been working so hard --
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
What do you want, a joke?
Lock the door.
That is not what I'm --
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
Uh-huh?
Yes?
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
You won't.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Everyone's invited, of course.
Okay, okay.
Barks his agreement.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
Sit down, and shut up!
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
Yes.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Or you ran into something ....
Probably an asteroid field ....
I take it back.
I'm against that.
You mean a man you can control.
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
Here ... near the Anoat system.
Can you trust him?
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
Thanks to you.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
I didn't say anything?
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Closer?!
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
No! .... Never ....
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
I want that ship.
We know that.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
And we can watch ...
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
They look pretty docile.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
Where?
What?
I got a new deal for you.
I see your point. What's the favor?
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
I don't know yet.
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
Having second thoughts?
So what does this thing do?
No.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
So where's Plissken?
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Looking to get out.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Are you crazy?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Who?
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
In the great book.
...of course...
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
That I cannot.
People make you laugh?
Why?
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
I?
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Well what's wrong?
Fuck it.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
What's this?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Maybe the circuit is busy?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
I can't believe it.
We still don't know.
Please.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
What's her name?
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
Sure did.
No I didn't know you had one.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
I beg your pardon?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
But how?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
Please.
No.
Oh............
When can I have one?
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Well you know it's okay.
You like him.
What?
Do you not like him like daddy?
Okay.
Why does God let us get tired?
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
Honey it's to help you.
That's good.
Oh, Christ.
No.
You might loosen the straps then.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
It would bring us together.
Uh Huh.
Ego te abslovo.
La plume de ma tante.
How's your leg?
Why?
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
In the face of the enemy.
The Lord be with you.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
Amen
Defender of the human race...
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
From the psychiatric end.
No I probably wouldn't.
Is that a threat?
Very much.
I've seen it.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Just a minute.
Yes.
I don't know.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
Little slow tonight.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Swimming trunks.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Baker.
How many?
How will he eat?
Two at a time?
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?
How we doing?
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
Lotta water.
Why the interest?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
Your doorbell doesn't work.
What?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
Let's get it over with.
Come on, stand still.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
Good idea.
Yeah.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Fine.
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
No. Why?
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
I don't know. Some disease.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Later.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
Spur of the moment.
Doctor's orders.
Yes, it is.
We're finished.
Impersonally.
Miss --
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Changed?
What's he talking about?
Do I look like I'm naked?
What's wrong with it?
Am I missing something?
Nine?
Big feet.
Right.
Piece of cake.
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
Smells like fish.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
Thanks, Lloyd.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Gotta go.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Come on, Ed.
Regular hours are eight to five.
He leads, I follow.
Not for money. With my mother.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Nothing personal --
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
I'm not upset.
Who's Nina?
Must've been a cheap date.
So, what happened?
Oh.
Coffee?
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
There's always another girl.
So how's the cat food business?
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
What's a prom?
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Yeah?
Sure.
Good to see you, Ma.
Eddie.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
How old is he?
It's important.
So you had a nightmare.
How come?
And you wouldn't be.
One last time.  It's important ...
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
What more proof do you need?
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
What happened?
What?
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Oh, that Karl.
-- Studying.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Im sure you do...
Seven.  Really.
Who did?
On a case by case basis...
Sure.
Thats where you work.
Kates my wife...
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
So could you write down her exact address?
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
Damn, you are the real thing...
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Everyone needs something.
Give me my goddamn life back!
How much time?!
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
I dont think so, thank you...
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
What?
You hear me complaining about that?
Yeah...fine.
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Do what?
Maybe youre not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.
Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me.
Are you sure?
But you always seem so certain.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Thats all I wanted to hear...
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Do I know you?
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
I'd like that, too.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
I've got plenty of places to go.
Merry Christmas...
Yes!
You'd never know it.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
Youthful high spirits.
He's made a few changes.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
Oh, he did.
And they're changing into...
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
That's terrible news...
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
So are you!
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Johnny.
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Not at all.
Hilarious.
Sure.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Reed, we're running out of time.
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
We need to get past them.
That's what we're here to find out.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
Of course.  Of course.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Raising the shields.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just <u>find</u> him.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Medical's ready.
Phase Two.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
Brain injury.
Here's the Surgeon.
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
No question of her loyalty.
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
We'll know -- in the next breath...
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
We're pushing oxygen today.
You may learn to like it.
I always thought it was nothing but red.
But I did. I'm positive!
I have no idea.
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Yes...
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
The Breath of God...
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Sort of.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Uh -- what?
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
I could use a lawnmower...
On the Repeater.
Then don't drift down further.
No Jean, no money!
Unghh... oh, geez...
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
What's this, sir?
No.
We split that.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
Oh, geez.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
GOT IT?
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Oh, he's adorable.
Officer Olson.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Oh, yah?
Uh-huh.
Uhn.
Uh-huh.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Sir? Right now?
I'm sorry, sir, I -
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Ya got the car?
Whatcha watchin' there?
You told me about it.
Yah.
Yah.
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
...There's a million dollars here!
Mm.
Call 'em up.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah.
Gotta go?
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Yah?
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
What'd he say?
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yah?
Uh-huh.
Yah, ya think?
Oh, fine.
I love you, Norm.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Congratulations, Jerry.
Where's Tyler?
Have you finished those reports?
Some of it, yes.
What?
I'll expose you.
The girl had done her homework.
Should we?
So you're staying in tonight?
Please.
Good.
Nothing.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Whatever.
What do you get out of it?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Answer the question!
What... ?
You are an insane person.
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Don't ask.
Who's this?
You fucking slut!!
What?
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Okay, everyone.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
...no ...no ...
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Strange.
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Doesn't matter.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
No, I'm not...
We don't... ?
Nothing.  Do what you like.
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
You know what I mean.
Nothing.
... is over.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
I don't know!  Tell me!
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
This isn't possible...
Stop finishing...
If you know, I know.
This is not about martyrdom.
Green?  Did you say green?
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Defuse the bomb, please.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Not exactly according to plan.
... no, no, no...
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
There is no money.
Yesssss...
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
Speed up.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Like what?
...My Premonition was just like his.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Who is this guy, anyway?
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
I know.  I can feel it too.
I...I don't know.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Thirty-nine.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
I wish you were on the plane!
You're the fuckin' devil.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
That's a plan.
"Next?"
I know who you are.
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
You saying Tod did kill himself?
No harm. No foul.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
No.
There's the Mekong.
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
One hundred.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
There are no worse places.
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
I need a vacation.
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
Yes.
How much we got left in that minigun?
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
Where's his father?
Sorry, Sir.
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
What's the plan?
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
About 22 hours on site.
American.  Come to get you out.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Well did you or didn't you?
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
Well, there's nobody special!
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
Thanks.
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
Uh... basement I think...
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Where?  Maybe we can.
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
It was a crime.
You can ask.
Fine.  I'll say no.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
What girl?  I didn't notice.
Lydia.  Lydia what?
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
Great place huh?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
The Little People?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Parry... I'm Jack.
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
Parry!
I don't know.
It's a classic.
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
What are the other reasons?
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
You won't be alone for long.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
What a gyp.
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
Twinky?
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
Serveza yourself!
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Fill it up.
How do you know it's clean?
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
No. How much do I owe you?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
That's good.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Very nice.
What?
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Yeah, me, too...
Tita, I've got to go...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
There's nothing to say, Tita...
I don't know.
No, thanks...
Where's Catherine?!
Tomorrow, then.
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
That's what you said?
Yeah, I think I could.
Catherine...
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
That's what I mean...
All right, let's have a rematch.
I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Then don't go out with me.
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
I, umm, came to see you.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
I kissed those girls.
I can't!
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Which one?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
Positive.
Not really.
Jus' from around the way.
You're kidding.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
It was planted on me, sir.
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Not a prayer.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
We play tennis at the club.
Your aunt?
There is?
Just relax.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Okay. Some idea.
Fletch...
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
I'm fine.
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Where are you going?
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Fletch?
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Sure.
Not me.
You doing a story on this guy?
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
You've met her?
John! You used to fly together!
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
Hi.
It's amazing.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
What is this?
That's what I want to know.
But I've seen the deed.
I'll take you to a game.
Gail, please.
Bastard.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
In her cabana, sir.
Very good, sir.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
I don't know.  Look!
What about finding the source?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
What...
Jim Swarthout?
Frieda's boss.
Of course.
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Excuse me?
But I am...
What did these Vancouver factories do?
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Right away!
No prob...
Exactly.
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Yeah, let's bury her.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
You're not funny.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Peachy.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
People still watch that?
Ye-ah.  Sure.
No, wait...
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
You need it.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Who's my real father, man?
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
Really?
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Fuck me...
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Only on a first name basis.
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
It is to us!  It's computerised.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Mr. Doyle.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Where do you want it?
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
But will they?
You're for real?
Willie Mays.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Who's on him?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
Let yourself in.
We put him to bed for the night.
What was it?
I been damn careful up to now.
What I know is what I told you.
Yeah.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
I'm alright, Gibby.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
Elvis has left the building.
Hey, bud.
Well, why not a little of the King?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
I'm serious.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
This afternoon?
I'm thirty-five years old.
1998.
Yeah...I think so.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
October 22, 1969.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
I'm right here, Dad.
It's not your fault, Dad.
No.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Hang on.
Sully!  Is that you?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Better.
Longbranch...?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Yeah.  Sure.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Sounds good.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
Yeah, that's right.
She's pretty special.
You have the right to speak to an att --
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
If you insist.
I vote for me.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Did you stay here last night?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
My whole world.
Yes.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
Don't say any more.
I have to.
Who's Horace?
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Why?
We're gonna scare him?!
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
It's just beginning.
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
I hope so.
Nancy.
I found it outside.
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
Will you listen, dammit!
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Yes, but they released me because...
There's no time for this bullshit...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
I'm here.
Yes.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Not so bad, today.
N...nothing.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
For a good reason.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
Oh my God, Steven.
Have a good night.
Yeah...
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Nothing.
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
It's...dead.
Nothing.
I packed it. Just for us.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
Oh dear God...
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
What are you talking about?
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
He is not.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
I'm staying.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I...I can't...
Really?
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
What is your location?
We changed our minds.
The window...
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Very big.
Very bad today.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Asbestos lining.
What was it like?
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Don't wait Efor me.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Except I won't have a father anymore.
Everything.
It's only our first date.
Yes.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Mystery. Deception.
All right. What's been going on?
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
Life is good.
You're hurting my head.
I'm at the door.
They're only gonna lose.
So what are you going to do about it?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Matthew's my grandson.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
It's a simple subject.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Because faith is rewarded.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
I have excellent long-term memory.
What color?
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
I think I remember.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Alla puttanesca.
Is what true?
Yes.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
As I told you about English policemen.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Eleven.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I thought you were a man of God.
Going nearer to God!
Did they take your clothes?
He said he's in charge...
"Hell!"
I thought you were against fighting.
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
That was England.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
Thank you. No.
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
Have you found him?
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
It's over.
I like football.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
Often.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
You know I'm scared of heights.
What are you talking about?
They found my eyelash.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
Good choice.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
I'm travelling too.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
How do I square the accident?
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
Why would we do that?
They found an eyelash.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
I can't do this.
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Just the way I remembered.
You were asleep.
For exits off Main Street.
That bad?
At least you were outside.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
You sent me to him.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
What do we do?
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
Not now.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Whatever happens it's over.
You and me.
I'll be ready.
What's wrong?
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Where do we go from here?
Pull over.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
Oh my God.
What about you?
Aren't we going a little hard?
Just sandwiches...
I kinda doubt it.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
What's it to you?
How about twenty thousand?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
When did you find out?
Who?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
I know.
Yes.
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Doreen.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
Once a week?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
What?
Who?
Oh, do you?
Go on.
No.
While he was here. You went about together?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Of course. Where else?
Especially when I play the lead.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Wilton Estate.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Yeah.
It never is.
Definitely.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
You sure?
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
Ta-ra.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
What about Keith?
How'd you know I wouldn't?
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
And that'll make me feel better?
How could I stay away?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yeah.
I have to. Things to see to.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
The gun he means.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
That's right, Harry.
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
That's right.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
Where am I going to work?
I'm not?
I had to.
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
With River Oaks?
Himself?
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
What?
What hard part?
That's the truth...
They...
How?
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
Yes.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
What did he say?
What will he pay?
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
That's none of your fucking business...
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
Down the street.
What?
No.
No.
Why?
Where did Moss...?  I...
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Go to lunch, will you...
Excuse me...
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Who are you?
Would you excuse us, please.
Levene!
Could I...
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
...do you want to go downtown...?
Roma.
You're saying that I'm fucked.
...let me...are you listening to me...?
Murray said...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
Yes.
And what if you don't close.
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
I have to go... 
I can't split them.
Because I say so.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
I don't know what you are saying.
Uh-huh?
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
What sales?
Only the beginning...
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Fuck you.
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
What does that mean?
You sold eight Mountain View?
From the store.
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Home cooking...
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Me.
What do I...?
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
If we wait till Mon...
I don't know.
The check wasn't cashed?
Tell me again.  Your wife.
We're going to speak to her.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
I...
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
And the check is...
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
The...
Some of them...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Some day you will.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
We have no money for a rug.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
Tom is right.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
I want you to help me, Fredo.
No.
It was hard to have him killed.
What's that?
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
How long does this go on?
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
Mike, at three and a half...
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
No questions.
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
You would have killed his brother?
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
The money was sent.
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
No, I'm fine.
That is a complete falsehood.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
They feel cheated.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Turnbull is a good man.
No, she's here.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
How much more a month?
What was that?
Just thinking out loud.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
It never crossed your mind?
You liked it too.
You mean us?
You will not hurt him?
Tea is fine.
Why?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
He is dead now, twenty years.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
What do I do?
But I didn't do this!
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
What did she mean by going flooey?
What was wrong?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
No.  I'm fine.
Your family ate dripping?
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
But we have to match the other sketch.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
How long were you...?
There's no people like you in my crowd.
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
David produced her last picture.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
The Great War?
I'm very sorry.
Not at all.
There are straps in back.
You're crazy.
I just want to watch it, okay?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Yes.  Perfectly.
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
Luminal.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
A visitor.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
One likes to live simply.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
I guess.
Righto.  Let me see.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Is there someplace we can talk?
Six years ...
Tell me about Kip -
What kind of job... ?
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
How ya doing?
I don't want him hurt...
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
What do you mean -- ?
No...
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Needs brightening ...
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
Hey, Donny --
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
Dignity...
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
What time of year?
Don't go there, Toby --
What am I supposed to do?
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
About what?
I can handle it --
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
What?
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
What for -- ?
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
What are you doing here?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
On account of me.
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
Six or seven...
Hey -
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
That what you want?
Oh. Okay. Right.
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
Cut 'em...
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
Excuse me --
Checkin' it out
Oh I Him.
Wha?  Me?
Nods.
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
You treated me like shit.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Shit.
What are you talking about?
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Let her carry this shit inside.
It'll be okay.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
You know. The stuff I left.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
It's been six months.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Yeah.
He heard.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
No, no. It's okay.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Yeah.
Oh shit.
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
All right, then.
--or a tail--
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
You don't know that.
No, I had to talk him down.
Yah, it's not a bad school...
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
You caught that, huh?
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
Yah, all right...
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
I'm Irish.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Retainer...
It's touching me.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
That's right.
Of course.
It's Saturday.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
Good to see you.
Since Nancy died.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
I need someone with your kind of background.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
I won't talk first.
I do.
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Come in.
Never been.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
There is somebody...
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
How about the ones on that shelf?
You think so?
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Time's up.
You've never been on a plane.
I don't know.
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
--No, have you had any experience with that?
It's not your fault.
What?
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Okay...
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Your house must have been a zoo.
We'll do that.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
Exactly.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
Not tonight.
Fine.
It's important that I learn this.
No.
I can't go out to California.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
What am I scared of?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
No, you don't want to hear that.
But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
Gallon or two?
What's it to you?
Sure, but what is this?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
Have a little snort?
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
They never wrote you nothing?
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Want to work, do you?
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Yeah.
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
California.
Sure. We aim to.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
No'm.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
I'd a found you, Ma.
Ya say we're acrost?
No.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
They know what--this fella looks like?
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
We gonna take whatever they got.
Morning.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
Yeah...
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
I'm Martin Blank.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
You could've been a contender, huh?
Insane.
It's nice to see you again.
Not much else.
Okay.
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
You see someone?
That'd be good.
Unbelievable.
As long as I get the laugh.
Okay... Hold on...
--She's not dead---
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Yes.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Come on.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Out Loud?
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
In Portugal, yes.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
And they want me to make up for it.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
There's nothing to be done about it.
I spoke to your father the other day.
Yeah. I guess we did.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
He sold me this bad boy.
He gave me a great deal.
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
All by yourself?
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
What's that to miss?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
You too.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
I won't ask you to.
Okay.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Fine!
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
What?
Then why do you want to leave?
I think they call it a pasture.
Hi.
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Well, one was for salad...
I'll take care of it.
About what?
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Good.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
Yeah. Bye.
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
No.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
About what?
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
May I have a suggestion?
I don't understa-
What do you mean?
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
I understand, but Annie, please...
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
You!
Diane!
No thanks.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
That's what some folks say.
I don't think Warren would go for that.
You're catching on.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I want to watch.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
NO!
You just showing off for her!
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Waste the dude.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Shh!
The sensitive type.
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
That's far out!
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Yeah? Display?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Mm-hmm.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Never heard of you. Done anything?
Fucked if I care, man.
Okay. Let's go shopping.
We did it!
Make it my first born.
You're not gonna win.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
I'll make it up to you!
I'm trying to help you.
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
Cancer?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
Congratulations.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
No, you don't understand.
I don't know!
What does that mean?
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Yes, sir.
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
You guys always look great.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
I can see this is useless.
How many people in the bus?
How many bodies did you find?
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
No way. No how.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Double scoops?
In a second.
It was the nightmare man
Coming.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
I've got you come on, go down.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
No.
Why?
You knew. You just didn't care.
I don't want to look pushy.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Right here, Ben.
What are we doing?
Got it Ben.
He's here, Sheriff.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
He's been here.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
We just talked.
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Why did you hang up on me?
Of course.
He was watching me.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Annie!
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
No, he's not.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
And I can't keep you interested?
Yeah.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
You all right?
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Sure.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
What did he look like?
Was it the bogyman?
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
Will you get her for me?
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Shouldn't we pick him up?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Mm-mm!
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Oh.
Right.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
What time do you get off?
Uh-huh.
Well...
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Hi.
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Oh, great.
I don't know exactly.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, Elliot!
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Everything's okay? 
I'm...all right.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
What do you expect me to say?
But not over me?
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
Leave me alone, can you?!
You're not lost.
It's on the table, Dad.
Oh, honey!
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
I'm saying it now!
Oh...
But not you.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
Yeah...but you're not dying!
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
No.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
I think so.
Football!
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
No, no, we decided!
Oh, sure.
Uh-oh.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Well, how about this?
Oh, yeah. 
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Singing?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
You know.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Look, everything's going your way.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Yeah.  Me, too.
We didn't hit it off.
Yeah?
...in a really horrible way.
Well, I hope you've changed.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Yeah.
Really?
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
God.
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
They're offering... 
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
It's a growth business.
Orderly.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Then who's buying it?
You want me to be?
Rich, comic book freaks.
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
I'm not.
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
...would you excuse me...?
You take this much time over everything?
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
Not with any certainty we...
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...Let's see the pigs, please.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
No.  And...
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
Exactly.
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
....what...? 
Let the girl go.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
...what's he got against you?
...standard issue...
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
I think its meaning is clear.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
How's your <u>child</u>?
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
I'll have them picked up.
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Enchante.
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
...yes, yes, yes...
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
...and my need for The Institution...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
N'not <u>that</u> sad.

Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...and that is what you need to expand.
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Or clear your windshield with it.

....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
Brazilian. 
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
...no...
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
I don't understand.
...why?
...yes...?
When?
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
You are the prince of the darkness.
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
I hope so...
What are you gonna do about it?
You guys have been so colossal...
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
Nothing.
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
Talia, you're a wonderful person...

No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a child, would you hug her and say everything's going to be okay...
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Shoot.
Ronnie!
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
All right.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Because you're an idiot.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Heather.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
I don't really like your friends either.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
French.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
I was just making it more special.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
No-o!
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
But my name's not...
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
Come on through.
Look who I've found!
breaks down into heavy sobs.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Open this door!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
Mummy!
Somebody's got to help us!
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
What??
That idiot boarder?
You mean travel by ourselves?
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Yes . . .
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
The way you just looked at me...
I'm stumped.
Okay so... what's the safest place?
Second most common?
You just made that up.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Yeah, how's that?
Really? Do tell.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Zero's a number right?
How many zeros was your wife worth?
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
But... I thought...
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
What?
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
Where's my wife?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
Thanks.
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
What things do you think you've done?
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
I surrender...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
LaPlante!
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
Allen?  He... he's okay?
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
How recently?
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
You mean John Bubber?
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
Lie, you mean...
Were you in it?  In the war?
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
You're sitting on your ticket.
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
What about a reward for coming forward?
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
What?
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
What about?
Who?
How are they with kids?
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Well, it's for a woman.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Sure.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Bye, Neil!
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
What?
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Fuck you, Philip.
Philip!  The senior partner?
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
He wasn't there.
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
We'll talk in the morning.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
What for, dickweed?
Grow up, Dreyer.
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
It's a double.
Even cosier.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Is that it?
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Aye.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Then it's worth the journey.
I'm sure they will.
How long is the voyage?
She's the King's cousin.
What worries you?
It's done.
Can you really tell from doing that?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
I cannot explain.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
What are you hoping to find inside?
A lucky guess.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
You got me.
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
I don't know anymore.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
I'm interested in mythology.
You look like you have.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Yes -- it is.
Get out.
What?  How?
What's that next to him?
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
That's what the Kurgan said.
It will not end tonight.
I know.
Me too.
I'll no forget you.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Fine.
Why?
It was stolen.
What do you want to do?
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
What are you talking about?
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
Keeps to himself, more like.
You fucked up, Glen.
Give me an ETA.
What hospital?
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
Where is it?
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
You sure?
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
I don't drink beer.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Whatever.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
What are we going to do about Mike?
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Yes, sir.
Are all of you named Jones?
Not until the man calls.
We're okay.
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
They're still in the house.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
You can let go.
Cockroaches?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Of course.
I'll be back.
Let me explain.
How many in your family?
And four children?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Yes we have.
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
The high command? Our high command?
The police are very busy.
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
You said you had no whiskey.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
How so.
I am on a list! What list?
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
Why not? We are half way there already.
Oh my God!
Fuck you.
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
When will they be here?
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
For supplies, you drive.
I saw the sign.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
Why sir?
That will take time.
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
What cards?
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
One thousand francs.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
How do you know?
The third floor are low class rooms.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
He wants your wisdom.
Of course.
What?
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
So where is the lamb?
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
No, no.
A kiss.
Yes.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
I want to know.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Why?
How dead?
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
I'm confused.
And what's Steven's status?
So what stopped her?
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
Is she alright?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
-- what was he doing here?
As a tumor.
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
-- fuck you!
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
Yes.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Up here --
Over here!
Most fun I've had all day.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
Better living through electricity.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
You've got your own TV show?
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
Question answered.
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
No, no, it's just --
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Good way to get your head blown off.
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
Oh, dear.
He must've unsealed the room!
-- ten.
What was her name?
What will they tell you?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Yes.  It was.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
I'm sorry.
Good-bye.
No it won't - no it won't!
Yes.
She talks to me.
She's down...how do you mean honey?
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Where is she?
Where is she now?
Take me to her.
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Daddy help!
I just, I don't know...
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Whatever you say.
Or what she was worth.
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
Aubrey!
Ok...
What's happening!
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
White meat will be fine...
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
So what should we do, father?
What are you getting at!
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
Yes, they are.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
And what is ... this frozen moment?
So where is it?
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Taken what?
I'll do it!
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
I'm sorry.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Fuck you!
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
Gum.
Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
But I said I was sorry....
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Oh.  Well, what's this?
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
You want an address on that last one?
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
If you think you're getting past me...
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Too bad.
I'm supposed to fall for that?
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
With a little jazz.
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
The Hudswinger!
The Hudsucker Hoop!
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
Adenoids?
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
I myself --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
...I'm sorry.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Now, Aim --
Consider this my resignation --
Oh Norville, I --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Phony, huh?
Says who?!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
What the heck they doin'?
This I know, Benny.
...Geez.
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Norville.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
-- tough titty toenails!
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
I haven't had --
You --
Wait a minute!
But, sir! --
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Well... I'm for it...
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
She looks in her purse...
Old Faithful.
She is!
She's damn good, Lou.
Where?
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
You mean a figurehead.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
Thank you.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
Yes -- on the boat.
Mr. Holland?
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
And charming?
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I love Fort Holland.
You didn't drive her mad.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
Yes.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
And as usual no one believed me...
I wasn't star--
So maybe you'll come too?
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Good night.
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
You go dry off now.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
You think I --
Elena.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Fine.
Yeah.
Stay out of trouble.
Ben--
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Huh?
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
We were just riding around.
Mom. Are you ok?
You're not a psycho!
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
It's not a bother.
Forget how to ride a bike.
But not too ashamed.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
See ya.
Do what?
Um, Libbets Casey.
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
You going to tell dad?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Thanks for the advice dad.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Sure.  Twinkie?
Wendy!
Huh?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Yeah.
Watching what?
Can I come?
Hey Sandy.
The ones you built?
Vodka?
One more shot?
That's all, for now.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
What's that, then?
What's the D.A. got them on?
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Okay.
Then change it.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
What time was that?
No.
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
Even the best make mistakes.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
What are we thinking?
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
You're not missing much.
You don't know.
Yes down at the station.
He.  Well, he...
There's nothing more to talk about.
Then so was mine...
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Surely you know the one who made you...
Listen to me.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
I didn't realise.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
I can't. Go away from me.
Yes.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Be still!
What danger?
Yes...
Yes...
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
And if I don't?
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
No...
What are you saying?
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
How could I not? She had to know.
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
No...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
No.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Don't even think about it.
Yes.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
What do we do?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Ray, we're just friend.
Can't what?
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
This weekend?
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
It beets being on the mainland.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
He's in it with Willis?
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
I'll talk real slow.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Rio, baby!
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Hey --
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
How much?
So why are you still here?
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Good winds and bad winds!
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
They were gore before I came here.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
No.  She shall not be left here.
I think not.
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
She has never mentioned her family.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
My last name is Pherides.
That should decide it or you --
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
It was, the plague
You wouldn't tell that 
I don't understand you.
Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Oh, now  now look here 
You are my friend.
If I told you  you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you  the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -
You see? Thea believes it, too!
I can't.
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Then foreclose!
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
You're nobody. You have no identity.
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
Zuzu's petals.
Where is she?
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
George Bailey.
I know. I know.
Thanks.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
Mother . . .
Well, what happened to you?
I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Goodbye, Sam.
No charge.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
All in . . .
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
I'm all right.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Nice girl, Mary.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
No.
Aw, get going!
No. No.
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
He's pretty young for that job.
Maybe you were born older, George.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Have a good time, son.
Very funny. Very funny.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She was here first.
Hello, Vi.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
This way.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Didn't you tell her?
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
Mary . . .
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
My baby.
Yeah, just started.
Left them at the office.
What the hell.  For you....
How fast is enough?
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
We're hung up on something.
Sean!  Catch it!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to swim home?
You bet.  Hang on....
Over here!
Happy to do it.
What camera?
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Yeah?
Pop.  I'm sorry.
Sean's still out there.
Did you get any pictures?
Is that what it is?
After we've looked, we'll talk.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Can't you tell?
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Late.
Home it is.
MMMmmmorning....
In the den.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Terrific.
Do you?
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Mike's out there.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
We have to do something.
I know, I know....
What?
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
What for?
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
It's all right, we're okay.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Help!  Help!
Who'd you ask?
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
Huh?
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
I dunno.  We'll think of something.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
What Kids?  Who went out?
What the hell is it?
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
I love it.
Sean, baby, please....
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Maybe.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Would you take him?
He thought he had a good reason.
Forget it, he won't listen.
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
With those camera lights and...
No.
What is it, 97 days?
See you later.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
I don't like what he does.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Yes.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Make up your mind.
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
Okay.
Sure.  Let's go.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
... He ought to put him in here.
Hydrophobia...
I can't take water, Kathryn.
But you --
Fine.  Have them do some.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Afraid I can't do that.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
And here I thought I was charming you.
He's missing.
Yeah, from Boston.
Massachussettans aren't.
Are you really?
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
I don't know, what else is there?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Now what's this do?
It's okay, Sean.
I am serious.
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Precisely.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Oh...
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
Right, Mike.
All right, hit those lights too.
... I'll go to McDonalds.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Yes, I did.
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
Tell Matt he should be here....
Then don't come any closer.
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I can't help it....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I won't....
You guys must be starving....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
I'm not going to quit now....
Good.
Why'd you come out here?
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I always listen to my feelings....
It could have been an accident....
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Why?
You're the man who drives the plane.
She said it was coming....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Good news travels fast....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
Will you leave me alone...?
You didn't stick them on right....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Put me down, damnit....
Forget it....
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
Lots of times....
So far..
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
I am...You must know something about him....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
I didn't ask you to....
Just trying to be helpful....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'Snuck up on me....'
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Screw you, Jake....
Mom....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
Anything to do before I go home?
Only me and Mom ..
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
I think you're here all day.
I already did. What's his problem?
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
Pay me, and I shut up.
You want me to stop the car?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
No.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
No .. But we have a theory ..
Maybe he's lying to you?
<u>You</u> put it in there.
Bullshit.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
Of course I would ..
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
How d'you know what I'm like?
I know.
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
I'm going back to the institute.
Why does he want to kill me?
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
You find something curious in that?
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
Whass going on here?
A derelict.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Could you just stop moving?
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Look, I don't want a --
No.
No.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
My son... my mind...
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Same to you.
Hello?
Thanks.
Hi.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
Do you have something to drink?
Yeah, thanks.
Plus, you could use that commission.
Oh good.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Why do you love me?
Tell me -- let me help --
You want...
So this break... is a break-up.
Thank you.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
Please, if I start talking --
Said who?  Sugar?
Mmm.  Hmm.
Yes.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Very much.
Huh?
Another drink please.
I understand your anxiety.
That's your word?
Great word.  Towel?
Fine.
Forget it.  Forget it.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
Damn right.
What --
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Not a chance.
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Shut up!!!
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Quiet!
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
What's a bad idea?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
People change.
I filmed this the morning they left.
Think.
How low?
What about Eric?
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
Sure.
KEEP GOING!
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
You think they could talk to each other?
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
The last of my breed.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
It doesn't matter what I think.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
Everyone, keep your voices down!
Not without a shot of the nest.
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
My vacation is over in a week.
That was about a year ago.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Okay.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Isn't it obvious?
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Why?
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
Piss.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
She's nuts.
I don't know.
I have to find Kelly!
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
But why?
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
What?
Where's Ian?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
Why?
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
The - - agility.  You're right!
Dilophosaurus.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
The fences are electrified, right?
Why not?
Like hell it is!
And scary.
Anti-nature.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Yeah.
He sends his apologies.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
No.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
You got me.
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
Not without massive sequence gaps!
You have no idea.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
Kids get scared.
We gotta do something.
For today, I guarantee it.
What kind of opinions?
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Who?
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
Thanks for the presents.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
They don't bother me.
What?
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
That's my job.
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Video store?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Insomnolesence...
There's a pizza place over on Market.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Great.	When can you do it?
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
How's that possible?
And if he's not?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
What was the matter with it?
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
I don't know what you could have read.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
-- In what sense?
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
In a manner of speaking.
An empty tomb?
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
No.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
It usually is.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
Orlac is an account?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
It's ... lovely.
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
They' re dead.
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
That's too bad.
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
What about him? Yes.
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
I'd just be guessing.
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
Didn't want you.
I guess he figured it was better.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
My name's John Klute.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Mm.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
How would I remember?
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Well, let's go down and ask him.
Is that what you gave him?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
How?
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
I don't get you.
No.
We did this before.
Yup.
What am I supposed to say?
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
With Trina.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
OK.
I believed her, Pete.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
It's not so bad.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Then how are you involved?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
I looked it up.
Yeah.
What else do you know?
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
What about your mommy?
Greatest...
On earth.
Wow!  French toast, really?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
You got a letter from mom.
Uh huh...
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's okay.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Sure.
It's my name too.
Uh huh...
Sure.
Uh, huh?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Like a principal?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Yes, your honor.
I do not, your honor, however--
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Then I have concluded my questions.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
No.
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
Such as?
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
Sure.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Kramer--
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
I'm going to take it.
Fine.
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Ted?  Are you there?
How the hell are you going to do that?
No, but--
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
No.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Ha!  You tell me.
Again?
And you have horses? You love horses.
General Chiang.
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
I am afraid.
Yes.
Then, we shall meet.
I miss my brother.
You could buy them.
I am him.
Please.
No. Not very big.
Ask whatever you will.
Can India help us?
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
The people will not allow it.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
I leave tomorrow.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
You decide.
Does he have the spot?
Is that a true story, or pretend?
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
Is that true or pretend?
I would not know. Maybe.
Ahh.
But, I have no experience.
No, Holiness.
Eliminate you.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
How could I ever leave?
It is a difficult situation.
I see that.
No.  Do you?
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
A spring trap!
No crocodile has ever--
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Get the gun.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
You do?
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
You talk to Bickerman?
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
Nothing's real.
Could we have intercourse?
Never been to Maine before?
So I don't like tents, why--
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
I beg your pardon?
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
Good.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
What are you talking about?
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
It's okay.
Ssssh!
You're mushing it a little around the--
Okay.
He's floating.  Take it home.
Keep firing!
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
Obviously I was wrong!
Other than to eat us?
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
I can look at dead things.
What kind of backup do we have?
It's just that--
Was he swallowed?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
I asked you to be nice to him.
You think Jack's handsome?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Yes.
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
He said he knew Karate!
I guess.
Absolutely.
Me too.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
<u>Kelly</u>--
Kevin told me you were upset.
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Why does she keep repeating the name?
He's here, Ardelia.
Hot damn, Clarice.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Get me out!
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Who's the subject?
And what is that, sir?
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
Murdered...? How?
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
Then please - do this test for me.
Why? Do you know something about him?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
Why so briefly?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
All right, then tell me how -
What was it?
Yes...! They were screaming.
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
You know I can't make that promise.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
I'm sorry.
Because what I am interested in is right here...
Yes. I want you to go.
Alice?
When? How?
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
And by sea!
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
We were headed...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Dark haired...
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
We don't.
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
: Only one or two loads.
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
What else?
What did you see, Major?
Webb's at Edward?
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
Atten-hut!
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
This interview's over! The militia stays!
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
France.
He did.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
What dead one on the ship?
Crunch...Implosion.
I got hung up!  Try this!
Just get in yours!
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Has it helped?
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
It bit me!
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
What's your air reading?
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
I signed-up for the stock option.
Timex...
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
He's tanking on us...
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
It's had a meal.
No fuckin' lie...
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
Hardly.
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
Seven hundred for the pair.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Can I help?
Yes?
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Jesus Christ!
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
All right, Dad.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Er well, yes we do.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
Just hold on, I got the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
How about you? All right?
There is only three of us here.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Out the back.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
He means they're thieving dogs.
What do you mean, me?
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
For half a million?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
That's going on optimism.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Twelve.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
Just shut up.
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
I'm sorry, sir.
I-I can do the job, sir.
I am, sir.
I do, sir.
He'll live.
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
Yeah.
So is Buddy on your short list?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Do I seem jumpy?
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
What?
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
You wouldn't?
Made some money, came back here--
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
If the next guy's a redneck.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
Seems like we have another one every week.
--Santiago.
You go by your old house?
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Hey, Sam.
And the ten thousand?
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
Well, you hire illegals--
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
He was killed.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
That's me.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Of course you can.
Yeah?
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
They've got my Amado.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Most people did, yeah.
Amado.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Yeah.
Nothing.
More, I hope.
What was your father's name?
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
Yeah--
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
You don't need to cuff me.
Just doing my job.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
You know who it was?
Uh-huh.
How?
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
That's so cool.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
I don't know where you'd start.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
That's my business. Harry.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
I wasn't.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
Yes.
Good.  There.  Yes?
No word from D'Amour?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
Somebody killed him.
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
I heard he was the best.
Oh, I've got plenty.
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Mine.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
No.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Shit...
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
What's her problem?
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
Have you been in?
They'll never find out.
Is that all?
Yes.
Looks that way.
You didn't try hard enough.
Yes?
I got to go.  I'm late.
No.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
Oh.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Ok.
I know, it's stupid.
No.
I know. I don't either.
It's Charlotte.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
I see them every morning.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Oh, she'll love it.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
We should get you to the doctor.
Working.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
A coke.
Around.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Thanks.
I'll miss you.
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
Good-night.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Do you want to- 
Ok.
Bye.
One moment, please.
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Good...I'm tired.
Sure.
I gotta go to work.
Ok, I will... later.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Do you think they have a room here?
Bad?
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
I can't believe Will killed him.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
What time did you make it for?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
My secretary?
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
Something he said, just before...
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Just open the door, please.
Father, I'm right here.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
Peter, please...
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
What?
When's your birthday?
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
What's the bible for?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
What did he say to you in French?
Not a lot.
I know who he is.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
We millionaires yet?
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Don't curse.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
I don't remember that.
That's ridiculous.
She's alright.
But you use potato?
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
This time get your feet set.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
What?
Get used to it, babe.
To do what you love.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Mom tell you to do this?
He's in college?
Too many times.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Just one word of advice for next season.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
He works at a bank.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
Oh.
For how long?
My Dad always drives my Mom.
So that means I have to ride with you.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Your legs don't look broke.
Would you watch the damn road?
You either.
Hey.
That what you think?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
It happens, right...
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Hey, what's up.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
Getting there.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
So you're gonna bitch up?
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
Okay.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
What mess?
What?
Tell me what?
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
You want me to fuck off?
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
I'm here, I'm listening.
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
Oh that's good.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
No.  No.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
baby, please, please --
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
I'm coming!
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
You don't have a boyfriend?
Who was it?
You just move in here?
Bit messy.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Good bye.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Bye.
Well I don't go out very much.
I'm sorry.
ok.
What?
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
Claudia.
It doesn't matter.
Sure, why?
Cynthia?
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
Son, don't --
-- no.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
That's confidential information, little man.
No Can Do.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
"The" cause of dullness in others --
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Stay that way.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Gently, son --
Don't do this, Don.
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
She loves you.
Who are you gonna call?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Alright.  Thank you.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Mm. Hm.
Around here.
Well I guess it doesn't.
Not a problem.
From '84 to '89.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
What name?  My name?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Yeah.
yeah.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
I went out last night.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
I need you to get me Paula --
Are you alright?
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
I'm drinking.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
Love you too..
I'm a bad person.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
What about now?
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
You're her boyfriend?
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
....it's alright....
...I don't....
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Do you have that?
That's it.
What do you do?
Maybe.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Shut up -- shut up --
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Love you too.
Sure.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
It's ok.
Hi.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
How goes that favor I asked of you?
I am with you!
Making the key to the throne.
Soon enough.  Here we are.
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
Yes, and he has a choice!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Three days??!!
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
You're a fool!
To the Bastille.  And death.
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
I know.  God go with you.
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
What use am I?
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
He is right, d'Artagnan.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
Raoul --
Athos, my friend!
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
Get out of my way.
What is its antidote?
She will be at the ball.
Just... water.
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
Yes, your Majesty.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Get out of my way.
Forgive?!
They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
Yes, yes, go on.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Raoul... is in love...
I... we are humble people...
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Cooperate?
If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
What do you need?
So what?
Where are you?
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
I didn't hit shit!
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
And who are you?
I'll live...
And he took a swing at you?
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
Could explain why Fleming was there.
Who is it?
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Figure you would have tried it already.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
What happened with the tape?
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Did you have sex with her?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
What's the bottom line?
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
Twenty minutes max.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Library of Congress.
I have to.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
I know...
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
The mark? Yes.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
What's it narrow down to?
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
What?
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
He had to.
Don't talk to me!!
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Have him peel the top label back.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
It's a surprise.
Yes, are you okay...?!
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Not me.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Absolutely,
Yeah. It's right here.
No.
No.
Uh... sure...
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
What about the dog?
What did he want?
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
What's that?
Are you George Sherman?
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
We don't know that.
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
I got it. Thank you.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
You're insane.
Yes.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Yes. I'd considered it.
I haven't decided yet.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Pretty well.
Yes.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Hi... am I late?
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Okay.  You're probably right.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
Then your father's a wimp.
Then your father's a wimp.
What?!?
No!  Andy, don't do it --
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
Yes, your Holiness?
Why??  I... I attend every year.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
I'll take my chances!!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
So your name's not Gorsky.
I used to think you were original.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
They're gonna lynch him!
What's your name?
Know what?
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
No way.  Not possible.
What?
Right...
I don't know... My computer...
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
Any time.
He's beginning to believe.
Yes.
But what if...?
The agents --
You could say that.
What does that mean?
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
More important than what is when?
You -- you're too fast.
The body cannot live without the mind.
Yeah.
What's going on?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
I need the main wet-wall.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
He is the One.  He is the One!
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
Why?
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
Are you worried?
No.
She told me...
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
I believe I can bring him back.
I'm coming with you.
I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
No.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
The Oracle.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Neo, this has to be done!
Because I believe in something.
Guns.  Lots of guns.
What the hell just happened?
Let go of her.
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Ok.  Wait here.
'And with your spirit.'
'Thou art then a king?'
Jewish...
Yeah.
And say what?
Panther!  Same thing...
Not quite...but keep trying.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Listen...I'm a guest here.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Did you see them run!
That's not going to help.
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
Don't be smart.
No.
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Get him in.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
How much was the original loan again?
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
We'll be here.
Fine.
I know.
That's nice.
All right.
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Here.
Well...
Anything specific?
Did you?
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
But...
The girls like it loud.
Yeah, so things'll be even.
You could say that.
Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Love that name.
He's cute.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Hi, Allison --
And you could care less --
Do they, m'dear?
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Hi.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Thank you.
Why yes, thank you.
"Death and Taxes"?
Of whom?
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
What'd it say?
Sounds good.
Do you think I need a haircut?
What?!
Yes.
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
As much as Joe's?
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Yours.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
I from dat nex' place.
No, no.  I on holiday.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
She knows you real self?
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
You love Allison, don't you?
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
I haven't.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Yes.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
And I appreciate you, too.
Girlfriend?
Yes.  I'm tired.
Why don't you get off his case?
Yes!
I love you in an evening gown.
Where are you going?
It gets worse.
Then don't.
We know all that we need to know --
Yes, that's why I said it.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Thank you.
Not at all.
Good night to you, Bill.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
I guess so.
I understand.
No.
Yes.
I don't understand.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Oh.  Okay.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
I don't know.
I wouldn't put it that way.
You tell me, Bill.
That's okay.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
And we're very grateful.
An indictable offense.
I guess you have your reasons.
That's life.  What can I tell you?
You fill the bill, Bill.
What?
I don't!
It's enough now.
Quiet.
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Thank you, Quince.
Next week?
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
How did you know?
I know it's none of my business --
Yer damn right.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
You and 'Honey'?
What's the way?
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
From what?
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
Couple days.
As requested.
This isn't my room?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
Yes.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Deals?
Don't remember.
Yeah. You?
Who did he go to meet?
Where is he?
I told him about your car.
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
No!
Get rid of Dodd for me.
Why not?
How do you know about me?
Are you Teddy?
Then why are you here?
I enjoy it.
I'll be waiting.							   *
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
From who?
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
No. You took them out.						  *
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Yes you do...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
25% discount on the load.
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
That's right.
Exactly.
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Twenty-eight-point-five.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
What'd Neptune tell you?
Alonzo...
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Five minutes...
No.
No.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Then you should.
This is Agent James Fujima.
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
Sonny...?
I don't understand...
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
You set this up!
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Do we need this...?
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Yeah, oh yeah.
I ain't sleepy.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
For money for what?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
Walk? Naturally I can walk.
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
What?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Ready for anything.
... and taxi fare for me.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
We go through the wall?
KNOCK IT OFF!
How's your hernia?
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Everything.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
The Hilton.
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
I know.
Not far. Just a little way.
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
Would you recognize him again?
Something like that. Cigarette?
About as good as it looks.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
What do you mean?
What's that?
Where is it?
Yeah!
What?  You gotta be joking.
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
What?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
I think so. One right, two lefts...
Oh, man, there you go again.
Just do it!
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
I pull.
Across both tracks!!
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Please.
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
No, there's...
Toss the flare down!
How?!
What-
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
Gross. What is it?
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
Will I be able to walk?
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
It has no nobility.
I can live with "great."
I'm getting to believe you.
The Sistine Chapel?
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
I DIDN'T...
Show me the way?
Yes.
Great.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
I want my pills NOW!
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
You really think so?
I think you're right.
No, I haven't.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
What thing?
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
I'm sure you're right.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
You're still a writer.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Sean, please..
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
I suppose I did.
Then don't say it.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
It's that time.  Go.
More like two-two point two million.
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
What are you talking about?
Right.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Uh-huh?
- torque wrench.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Indeed.
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Affirmative.
Why did you phrase it like that?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Twice.
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
She sacrificed herself..
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
I'm fine..
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Nyah still on the property?
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
By asking me.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
So what do you suggest?
S.O.P..
What about him...?
Good idea.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
All ten million.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
What happened to Jim?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Who is they, who is they?
I'm going to answer it.
What about you?
They knew we were coming.  Golitsyns dead too.  The disk is gone.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
Yeah.  I follow you.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Who else is left?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
I'll get you close.
About what?
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Just waiting for you, tubs.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
- and picked us up in the States -
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Im dead and gone.  God knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
They stamped it, didnt they?  Those damn Gideons.
Loud and clear.
Jack...that's spying.
Jack you're so wicked.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
This wasnt what we discussed.
Connection denied.
And I'll have the special fish.
And go to confession.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
No. You were there.
Bed.
What's your news?
You did this once it didn't work out.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
Maybe.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
He's in Palermo.
Let me come and talk to you.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Loretta.
He knew my husband who died.
Seven years ago.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
You think so?
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Where are you taking me?
What did you do?
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Come on.
No.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
Hi.
No?
She was too young for him.
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
Bobo, take the cart away.
Yes?
A month from today?
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
You have a brother?
How was your plane ride?
We should talk alone.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Everything's different.
No. Are you drunk?
Did you see it?
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
It's late.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
But why would a man need more than one woman?
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Sure!
It's nothing!
I'm a housewife.
Why do men chase women?
Yes.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
Sure.
Oh.
Did you dress her up like this?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
You said it again!
So be it!
Had enough?
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
I warned you!
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Man!
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Shut up!
Bloody peasant! 
Come on, patsy.
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
Course it's a good idea.
Do me a favour.
What is your name?
I can't take him.
I think I could pull through, sir.
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Is it?
What - the curtains?
But, Mother ...
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Oh, I see,  Right.
What is your name, handsome knight?
Sir Galahad!!
Ector.
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
Look.  I'm warning you.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
The good-looking one.
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
Aye.
Get out.  Out!
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
Mr Brown, sir --
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Of course.
I see.
Out of my way!
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
My own.
We --
Back and upper corridors.
Aye, do.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
In time, she will.
Ma'am.
She's well, too.
Yes, ma'am.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
Are they worth reading?
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Yes, ma'am?
I do not accept.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
I'm breaking no promises!
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
So?
I hope he got his mother's permission.
To know when he'll be king.
You can't know that for sure.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Whom?
Just them?
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
Why?
Your Majesty --
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
Did you play ARCADE last night?
I came from the city on the left.
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
We are talking...
It's twelve-thirty!
Funny.
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
Sure.
No way.
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
She thought Benz was at school.
Laurie's.
And beat it at it's own game.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
No I'm not...
I can't believe you made it!
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
Put in a quarter.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
Right, then...
What?!  There's nothing here!
We don't have a choice!
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
I'm okay.
Yes...
That way.
You have no time.
Of course I am.
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
Give her a chance, will you?
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
There is no problem.
No problem. What's on your mind?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
Okay.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Well, I ...
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
You got it! See you later honey.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
But it said #12.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
You don't remember anything else?
Mulholland Drive?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"Before what?"
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
What is it? What do you see?!
Do you know them?!
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Could be unrelated.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
What's going on ?
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
I'm working on it.
I'm leaving.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
Excuse me ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Okay.
Girder, watch your head.
I work here, remember ?
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
I told him not to sit down in there.....
Are you hunting wabbits ?
What the fuck are you talking about.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
What ? Are you my mother ?
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
I said NO.
You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
He probably has a history of this shit.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
I don't know.....
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
<<belch>>
What happened ?
Excuse me, gentlemen
Do you want to go out with me ?
Yes.
Hi. I brought some wine.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Which one, this door is locked !
What ?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Who was that guy anyway ?
Good morning.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
I would do it again in a minute.
What do you remember about her.
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Pommeroy.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Great.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Hi Dad.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
You mean, you knew about me?
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?

More than anything in the world.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Well...
Come on in!
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
He likes you.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
But I wanna write about her.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
I want juice!
You're so clever.
You're over reacting!
TAXI!!!
Oh my gosh, here it is!
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
Change my name.
What if you don't wanna be found?
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
You would.
Give it to me!
Leave me alone!!
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Like what?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
Committed.
Yes, it does.
You know how I feel about you.
Not exactly.
Bye Niece, Vada.
Nothing, nothing at all.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
I was commenting on your hair.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Sort of?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
I bet your mom sang to you.
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
Good for you baby.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
WHAT?
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
Yes.
No.
I think it's still available.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
Yes they are.
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
I'm sure she will.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
No. Just, more activity.
Did she ever see Vada?
Here?
In ages, I know, me neither.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Oh, Vada...
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Why do you think she says that?
Oh.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Uh huh.
Mostly love, and romance.
Can I use your bathroom first?
No.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Have you ever tried any?
Come here, sit down.
Aarrggh.
Liverpool?
What?
It's my mother.
What?
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
I wanna live with them too.
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
He likes her better than me.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Well, let's spit on it.
I should look different.
Something like that.
He's still in love with you.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
No, he's ruining yours.
You like her.
Try less appropriate.
I can't even say it.
It's too late to start over.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
Well, we're...
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
Ju...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Gold nose hair clippers.
Hello.
I just don't want to freak him out.
... that this is all my fault?
... look good on Kimberly.
I know Ben.
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
Well, somet...
W...
Mirrors.
... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
Such as.
Endearingly absent-minded.
She finds him "personable."
What, leaving school...
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Michael!!
You keep saying that.
Me either.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
Yes.
She admits it's her fault.
Oh, yeah.
... yeah, that.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
I came here, looking for her.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
... and you knew about this.
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
An so it is.
Well, that just happened that time.
You got a real good memory, Star.
Grand Old Opera --
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Bye, Bye.
She's going to rest now.
Okay. Thanks.
How is that?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
You know better than that.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
How come?
National?
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
What is a turkey shoot.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Hi, Sherry.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Suits me.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
No.
Nash.
He's a member of our congregation.
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Hi.
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I have to go. He sighs.
Fifteen minutes?
Linnea?
Hundreds of times.
For him?
Mary?
How long have you been together?
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
Where are you from?
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
You think I got any kind of a voice?
Is that good?
You think I should take lessons?
Sure thing.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
That's what Tim said.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
I see.
How's it goin'?
What?
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Ready.
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
She sings? What does she sing?
Let's do it.
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
When have they ever been right?
Sure.
So, what now?
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Unfortunately, yes.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Yes.
Survival of the fittest.
Next week's episode.
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Yeah, sure.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
You think so, Frankie?
All right, you get out of here, man!
Okay.
I'll smile when it's funny.
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Where was that?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Okay.
Name's Duff.
Thanks.
Well, he worked around.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Okay, thanks very much.
Okay.
Oh yeah?
You must be new in town.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
You got a problem all right.
Don't Duff--
Take it easy.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
Why did you?
What d'you mean?
Just for the day?
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
Four.
How about it?
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Yeah?
Don't call them that.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
You didn't answer my question.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
Yeah.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Yeah!
What're you going to do?
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
There's nothing to say.
Duff--
Take it easy, Frankie.
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
'Bye, Jocko.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Plannin' on getting married?
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
Sorry.
How are you?
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
That'll make the folks very happy.
Hi.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
Okay, boy, beat it.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
I'm fine.
No. I only needed the code from you.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
The Elders, mon...
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
What are you talking about?
I find out now.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
Yeah.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
It's coming.
No!... No...
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Couple of months.
What?
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
A regular Fagan.
Give me five minutes.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
I'll be okay.
What went down between you and Riviera?
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Yeah, I know.
Exactly.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Nope.
If you say so.
Roger in Op/Ed.
Yeah.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Anita, remember espadrilles?
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.

Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Transitioned?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
See!
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
Do you remember high school?
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Rufus?
Really?
Thank you.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
But now you don't have to--
What?
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
We're very evolved.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Yeah. Definitely.
Maybe we should sit.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Lock.
We went through the door...
Barrel.
We can handle it.
No!
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
I can't help it.
Just what?
Good.  I'm hungry.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
He's dead, you bitch.
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
I know.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Wow...
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
Whoa!
I don't know - a sharp pain.
Oh, Jesse...
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
I can't!
'Morning, honey.
You okay?
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
We're going to bed.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
First door up the stairs.
Can't it wait till morning?
They're healing up nicely.
Research.
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
He's close...
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
I don't know.
I think so.
Can't be good news coming from you.
So?
Fuck off.
Thank you.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
Nancy...
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
I can do that.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
How do we get in?
What?
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
This is stupid.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
I forgot my bag.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Yes.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Come in.
This is the place.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Well done you.
My son's name is Johnny?
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
No.  What's that?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Is that right?
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
... get fired.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
Yes -- sort of...
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
What's your name?
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
So it could have been neither of them?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
I think you do, yes.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
What are the choices?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Two?  That's it?
Absolutely not.
What?
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
And she's in your house.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
No, Miss Ratched...
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Would you like to start?
Mister Sefelt?
I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
No! No! No!
Will you come with me, please.
Yes, ma'am...
Go on...
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
No, it was irresponsible!
Yes, ma'am?
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
H-H-Hearts.
B-B-Billy.
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
O-o-o-oh...
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Ca-na-da...
What? Where?
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Let me get on your shoulders.
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Shhh...
We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
A pecking party?
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
With your own two hands?
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
What for?
I don't trust you!
Sure, Mack...
No!
Gary Blinker...
Hold it a minute.
Yeah, Mac?
Me, too! Me, too!
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
Oh, what was that?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
'Kay!
Because I quit breathing.
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
You're on!
Sure...
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Yeah, what's up?
'Kay...
You's better believe it, brother!
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Oh, yeah...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Hi.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
So.  How do we get to Rome?
What for?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
No.
Let's find a telephone.
You're sure...
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
What's mezzaluna?
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Amazing.
Non.  Please.
My name's 
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
NO.
You didn't answer my question.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Please.  I need to know.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  I just came by to apologize.
Well.  Congratulations.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
I would call it-- unforgivable.
There is no us.
Just since yesterday.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
And more...
Oh, hello.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Oh.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
He's a podiatrist or something.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
You don't have a passport.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Maybe.
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
What is it?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Hi.  Where've you been?
Packing.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
And Larry?...
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Right.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
He missed me.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She's not here.
Good strategy.
That's really romantic.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
Gimme.
I'm not thirsty.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
That was the idea.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Don't say that!
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
Why Edie, I
Give it to me my Pop's job
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
You training to be a nun or something?
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Do you like pigeons?
I only live up there and across the roof.
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
What for?
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
You?
What I did to Joey.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Who is he, Pop?
You are like
Someone else c'n take your confession.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
What do you want from me, Father.
Mind your own business, Father.
You go to hell.
You go to
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him boy, I was ready that night.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Yeah?
Raise a hand to me and... .
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured  They got it made. Eat all they want fly around like crazy sleep side by side and raise gobs of squabs.
Be sure they got enough water.
Take it easy now, Terry.
Hit me again.
First things first.
Hey look-
Forty-five bills.
Gimme.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
Aw, Johnny... .
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Keep Charley out of this.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Okay.
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Be careful!--They'll see you.
Nothing is worth your life.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
What can we do against them?
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
Maybe so.
A symbol, Master.
Ahh, she will be yours.
Ahh, there is yet time.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
I will decide the conclusion.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
Aannnnaahhnn.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Yes, it is.
Who is it?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
I know a Glenn.
He didn't want me to.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Thank you.
His assistant.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
You better come see this.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
Shit.
Uh-huh...
Sure looks that way.
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
You know how I felt about her.
Yeah, I did.
They sure do.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
All you gotta do is get in.
Jack --
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
You're gonna use a ram?
Call and tell you.
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Wait, I know him --okay?
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
A little.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Uh-huh.
Peter Finch.
You'd probably tell me.
You have to be kidding.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
You won't do that.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
It smelled.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
She did, huh.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
To warn her about Chino.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
In the trunk?
Yeah?  She said that to you?
You know who they are?
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
What's to think about?
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
How are you, Richard?
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
Meaning time came, I left.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
Like what?
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
You're not?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
Great.  We got one of 'em.
Oh...
He said he stayed here last November.
What're you doing at Glades?
You used to like it.
I'd like that.
What'd I say?
I didn't have time.
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Well, I need that...
Where the fuck is Foley?
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
That's me, Sir.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Sir, I --
A m-missionary?
You guys are new?
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Yeah.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
I'm out of fuel!
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
Have the planes made it to China?
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
I can't. It's all too much.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
That loudmouthed little bitch~
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Refresh my memory.
Would you?
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Is this slow enough for you?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Right here. Now sit down.
I know.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Touchy, touchy!
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Don't you get along with your parents?
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
For everyone.
What?
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
At my age? Don't be silly.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
This morning was good.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
What does Charlie think about that?
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Why not? They're my favorite.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
Sixtyforty.
Come on. You can't be serious.
What are you talking about?
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Wait! I'll go with you!
Pretty much so.
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
There's a better place...
What did?
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Bob...
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I said, don't worry about it.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
No.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
Honesty is always best.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
What?
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
Thank you.
Charles. Okay. Miller?
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
What?
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
No.
Really?
Absolutely.
Thank you.
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Thank you. No more questions.
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
Right.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Uh.... No. Not really.
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
That's correct.
Give me the camera, Joe.
Who?
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Yeah... ?
Night, honey.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
We ought to be suing him.
Andy, you don't want this.
Charles...
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
... It's time to get this society back on track!
Lookit. Lookit!
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
'Mean the whispers?
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Get out of our way.
Don't do this to me....
But they...they could still be....
I would try for them.
Not sure. Ten?
Possibly.
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
Like what?
I assume he licked it clean.
Let's just be sure.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
60 years ago.
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
We're all on the same hajj now.
What?
Which half?
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
I'm born-again.
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
You still don't believe me, do you?
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Zira....
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Him.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
What signal?
Forget it. Abandon ship.
long pause) You know it.
Climb off me, will you!
Don't bother
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
He wouldn't leave her.
Why special?
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
Okay.Up to the cave.
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Shhhh!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
This is his assertion.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
Says he can't walk.
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Youse so fucked up man.
What?
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Over here!
Yeah.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Dawn...
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
He dugged his own grave.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
These two holes are yours...
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
I don't know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
Thank you.
Yes?
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
How long would that take?
Bank?
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
As I said before...
He got in here how?
That's all there is.
No thanks.
That's putting it mildly.
Dance? Here?
They know you here--know your name.
Nothing matters.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Ale. I don't mind.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
We wouldn't have met at all.
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
You understand perfectly.
Because you think your in love with me?
What will they do to you?
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
We know everything.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
All right. Get him.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
For two hundred?
I've got good ears.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
That COULD BE TOLD.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
You get it's brother.
Open it and count it.
So it seems Sergeant.
I've met her.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
I think so.
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
The card says so, doesn't it?
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
Aye.  You have a point there.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
Not too far, I hope.
Nice.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
What does it look like?
You already have the checks, darling.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
In an hour, Larry.
It's fine, thank you.
Yes.
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
Of course.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
No.  I'd want to--
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
Both dead.
Very thoughtful.
I have to be up early. 
What did he want?
That'll be fun
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Yes, finally.
Suez.  1956.
Take a look at these.
Dad.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
That's good.
No.
Darling Susan.
Promise?
I won't.  Goodnight.
No.
De nada.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
Once.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
You gotta earn trust.
My man!
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
Yes, sir.
Sir?
Babes.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
The shit they pull, huh?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Okay, Dad.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
They took a left at the next light!
Kid, get outta the way!!
Shrimp and fries.
I'm serious.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Who cares!
What do you mean?
No way, old buddy.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Anytime.
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
Thank you, Sergeant.
There's no sign of it.
Twenty-five percent.
No.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
Who indeed...
You've got a lot of nerve.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
What's that?
No.
You're not from L.A., huh?
Fine.
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
What are assets?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
All right, two thousand.
Done.
You're forgiven.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Dinner can wait.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
What do you mean?
Vivian...
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Why?
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Kit!  Where've you been?
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
You're a guest here?
And who is that?
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
Professionally?
Miss Vivian.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
'Scume me.
Yeah.  Thanks.
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
As you wish.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Who's Guilder?
You never said anything about killing anyone.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
I'm waiting!
How many could you handle?
-- where?
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
I'll be right back.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
I don't be-leeve this.
Because I can stop now if you want.
Do you want me to go on with this?
Okay.
As you wish...
It won't be easy, Sire.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
DEATH FIRST!!
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
And our assets?
-- offer me money --
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
What's that?
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Inconceivable!
Morons.
Australia.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
An hour.
A good hour. Yeah.
What are you saying?
"Of the silvery moon,
"I want to croon,
Ooooooops.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
It's nothing ... nothing.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
Coney Island??
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
No way out.  No way out.
Yes.
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Got dag pa dig.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Heil you know who!
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
What do you do best?
I'm not the police.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
If she paid you well?
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Money.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
What?
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
I hate tears. 
Yes.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Where could he have gone?
You're not.
Neither will I.
Watch your tenses.
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
Hospital clean.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Sam! No!
Sam, let's go get married.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
To a private island, like you?
Very early. Dawn.
Then I'm free to go...?
Why?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
Maybe you saw Mary!
At this hour?
Leave me alone!
From what?
What--special autopsy?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Who are you? What is your name?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Maybe you're right.
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
That's it. You get it quick.
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
Yes.
No?
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
So that's the way it is?
Thank you.
What do you think I am?
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
You give me a pain!
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
It's all yours.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Good night, sir.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
You did.
Yes....
I'm heading out of town.
That's the physicist's playground.
It's an experiment.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
Is Rose here?
Where is she?
Nobody.
You were pretty bad, huh?
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Good night, Rose.
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Well, yeah.
I don't know.
Well, it's not very plain.
Daddy, what's the matter?
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
What did you say, Brother?
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
What?
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
What did you forget?
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Yes, sir.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Well, it's Billy.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Tennessee?
No, you're not.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
Fair enough.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
What... ?
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
I got him.
Yeah.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Entertainers don't count.
You don't smoke.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
It's not gonna happen.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
It's go time, Billy-B.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
You're lying...
Nope.
Well, sir...
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
It's our job.
You know... you could say thank you.
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Don't crowd him.
No you're not.
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
All for one...
Dead.
Gimmie a minute.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
I'm well aware of that.
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
Fine. Together again, huh?
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
It'll work. It'll work.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Hold me.
All right, hang on.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Your Royal Highness.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
Your father?
I will not fight you, father.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Dammit, Janet.
Yes.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Yes.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
From Transexual Transylvania.
So come up to the Lab.
Oh my, my,
You're too kind.
The delivery boy.
Creature of the night.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
...Goodnight, Rocky.
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
Absolutely.
By accident?
...I suppose.
...No thanks.
Yes, I do.
No, I don't belong here.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
No... Sharp -- You look great.
That so.
It's not your house --
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
What?!
...Stop jivin'!
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Move your shoulders down.
No wine.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Bob.
You have my food in ya hand.
...Fine.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
You think I don't hear things?
Gonna try.
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Black market?
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
Rocky.
Sparrin'?
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
What?
'Night, Marie.
I said, how ya feelin'?
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
When was they here?
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Real good.
It ain't your locker no more.
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
'Bout what?
...Adrian ain't sharp.
I'm thirty myself.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
...No.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
A tweeting bird?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
I'll bet.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
Why didn't you tell me?
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
So's the job.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
I've already seen your photographs.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Take it easy.
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
Aah!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
No, it's not.
I rest my case.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
From this box here...
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Why, what is Tybalt?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Young Romeo is it?
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
She'll not come down tonight.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Well, what was yours?
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Right.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
I thought all for the best.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Of course.
Is that right?
Who the fuck are you?
And who are you?
And then...
That's him.
They're good!
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
I think not.  After you...
I take it you still want the money...
But you hate each other!
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
Now that is an interesting proposition.
Really?
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
My way is better.
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
Eat shit and die slowly...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
I don't think so.
As in, they own it?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
So is the woman.
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
Because that's what I would have done...
Gregor's cell phone...
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
Not exactly.
Very ugly.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
I don't know...
So I do it.
I think not.
Just like that?
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Do you have a good answer?
Finish the job...
Finish it!
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
I can't get enough of it.
I don't know what you're -
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
What makes you so sure?
At the expense of six people.
I don't know.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
There it is...now what about the others?
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
Then we're screwed.
That's right.
He killed her...he killed her...
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
What's your offer, Jesse?
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
What's that?
Are you sure you're OK?
Nothing happened?
I know.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
I love you Sally.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
This just might be our ticket!
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
Have you known this all along?
Dwayne.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
We are having a sale on some items over here --
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Right behind you.
You're never getting that much.
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
You've done without it long enough, ma.
Give me the bad news.
We're going to find out.
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
I'd like to see you try.
Is this about the funny money?
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
I don't think so...
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Those girls drove off because of you.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
No.
I knew you were lying.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
This is a very dangerous man.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
Who died?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
No.  She's a school teacher.
What?
I cannot go to LA...
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
What did you say?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
What is it?
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Who's Benjamin?
End of the line.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
No.  I'm going to find out.
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
Carter...
Some Kung-Pao?
Amen to that, brother.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
I need your help.
How do I know I can trust you?
No.  But I'll help you.
Now you know.
The Secret Service?  Why?
Don't.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
No.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Come on!
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
Yes, I know this song.
Yee-aww.
No, fish is a PM food.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
You know him?
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
They put you in charge?
It's called a dress.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
It's okay. For restaurants.
At this point we don't have much.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Do it!
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
Han?
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
I was trying to find the right time.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Thank you.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
What?
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
I don't know.
You're coming here?
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Tootaloo.
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
You'll answer my questions?
You have one?
A pre-wedding luau?
He is not!
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Of course.
You know, there's no...
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Of what?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
A little longer for me.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Me?
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Lighten up, what?
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
Thank you, Dad.
Yeah.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Does it have wheat in it?
It's just like my grandmother's china.
It was my mother's.
What was what?
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
"I want to meet you..."
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
I always wondered about that too.
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
Becky?
Thank you.  I love you.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
So I mailed your letter.
I know.
I know. 
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
Any time.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
What?
It's a sign.
Hello.
It's me?
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
Have you had any relationship since?
It's hard to imagine.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
She died.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
Why not?
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Seventy... eight.
Yeah.  What's that?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Window.
I don't think I have to now.
It plays in 50 states.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
Oh, right.
There she is.
It's only ten o'clock.
Victoria? She's okay.
Are you going with her?
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Did not.
Get out.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
If I didn't go.
No.
Hi.  Sam?
Microwave.  Five minutes.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
No thanks.
Whose side are you on anyway?
I don't make policy.
I say we gotta take action. Now.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
It never ends.
Yeah.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
They are singing for me.
No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
What?
What's more important than sanitation?
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
What has it got me, your union?
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Be still ...
Sun up.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Like what?
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
But honey ...
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
What attitude?
Shhh.
Did you see his hair color?
You like that?
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Everything go?
Colette ...
Nothing.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
How?
Don't worry. He's out of town.
You really need to lighten up.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
Therapy session is over.
Danny, it's not what you think.
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
No  You think she's a tweaker?
Sure, Jimmy.
Yes, Jimmy.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Make me an offer.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, okay.
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
I'll keep that in mind.
Yeah, dickhead.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
It's not my place.
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
When?
Question is, what are you doing here?
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
To who?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
That would be me.
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
That is so unfair.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Spit it out, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
The Army gave you that?
Shit, that was no big deal.
Shut up, will you?
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
I'd love to hear it.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
You don't count.
Those guns are close.
I changed my mind.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
PUSH!
Three for three.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
Let's just find someplace.
Vecchio.
Out of the mouth of babes.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
But, sir...
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
There's always a bright side.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
HERE THEY COME!
Get back to your positions!
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
Alright, come with me.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
And Sarge?
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
What about you, Captain?
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Who knows?  It worked.
Twenty-four-five.
Because he's guilty.
Understanding the following rights...
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
Lloyd.
Okay, I got it.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Meaning?
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
I dream about it.
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Okay, I give up.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
I'm fine.
But I found the money.
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Hi.
Look at those eyes.
Hi.  You called me?
Thank you very much.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
No, I read it on the message.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Well, not monumentally.
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Eight.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
No.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Twisted?
What?
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Come on.
Okay.
Yeah?
Am I wrecking my car?
Oh.  I was putting the...
Yeah.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
No, I don't, I don't.
No I didn't.
No.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Man, you're bringing me down!
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
No.
No.
Fine Lloyd.
How do you pay for one of those?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
I'm totally and completely serious.
She's very successful.
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
I know this part, keep reading.
No way.
Hey.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Alright!
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
War.
It's a beautiful city.
Yeah, what's that?
True.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
I just told you.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
Yeah.
Things are great, things are great.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I need a drink.
Wine?
Pistols?
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
Yes.
Thank you.
And killing.
They're withholding payment.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
They've broken their pattern.
I won't.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
What? I can't hear you...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
That's okay.
Where is everybody?
What if I said you?
Why would you wanna do that?
I'm inquisitive.
Don't forget to set the alarm.
Please, Cotton, dont do this.
Its over, Cotton.
Did you do it?
And much richer as a result.
Home--where he lives.
Why don't you ask them?
No, I don't.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Youre all in this together?
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
Not one bit.
Sid, you don't have to.
I got it..
Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.
Until now.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done.
Tuitions expensive.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Not good.
Meaning?
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
..and as lonely as I am...
C'mon. Let's go.
I'm everywhere.
Are you in danger now?
Where is your attacker?
What?
Don't do this.
Yeah, right.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
Her old boyfriend?
..harmonica style is okay.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
We got free tickets.
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
Don't panic.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
To me Hollywood is about death.
What did you know about your mother?
What Rielly?
No.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Always.
And?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Fuck!
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Need to get in that building?
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Huh, fine.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Roman that's not the line.
What?  What movie?
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
Who is this?
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Are you sure?
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
What are you doing here?
What's that?
Hey, hey, it's just me.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
It's been a year since she died.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
What?
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Stop it!
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
What number is this?
I want to talk to you for a second.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
What's that noise?
You're making popcorn?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Don't hang up on me.
You getting scared?
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Your call.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Deputy... good evening.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
You're sure it was the Hilton?
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
We haven't located her Dad yet.
I told you to send it back.
Not my daughter... not my...
You want to go live?
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
I owe you shit.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
And why would she do that?
That's the original part.
Right here.
Hello Sidney.
Who are you?
Sleep tight, sweetie.
You got it.
And what would be your motive?
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
What happened?
No way.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
They think it's school-related?
I'm not worried.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
Ease back, Mills.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
What are you talking about?
I heard.
It's always been like this.
He's not finished.
It would be too hard.
I'll see you.
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Hello.
NO!
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
Shut up!
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
Can we talk about this in private?
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
What?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
What about sports?
I read.  Remember reading?
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
Bear with me.
No.
And you don't?
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
I don't.  Neither do you.
It's not what you think it is.
That is.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
What did you say?
I can't do this now... please.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
I'm sorry, I only...
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
Huh...? No...no water.
Dunno...Seems so.
Yes sir...
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
How far's the river from here, Mose?
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
You got it with you?
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Oh...
Scar?
Look?
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Never heard of him...
Not likely.
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Not far from it...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
No...not yet...
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Ain't worth the mendin'...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
I got to fetch her home...
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Come on, say it.  You know...
You'll never get away from me!
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
It still worked in town.
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Do you have a better idea?
Yes, daddy.
We just have to make a new beginning.
So do I, believe me.
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Tenth floor.
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
It's good.
The title won't do.
Right you are, governor!
Writer, is he?
Twenty pounds on delivery
Ask him.
See you in jail.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
On my mother's side the Ardens
Put his feet in.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Oh, that.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Very well.
Yes, but very well.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
Who are you?
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
What? Who?
No, it will turn out well.
What do we do now?
How will it?
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Do you think?
"Is the day so young?"
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Your Majesty.
There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
I like her.
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
The same, alas.
Can you love a player?
Well perhaps better than my first. 
Yes, some of it is speakable.
That's my line!
Oh, but it will end well for love?
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
A literary feud. Quite normal.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
and thus unable to declare her love
Nor you for me.
You flatter, my lord.
I do not love you, my lord.
The Queen has consented?
Do you understand me?
Does she say so?
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
I haven't lost yet.
I don't have time.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Think about it.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
I don't know.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
So I gathered.
Yeah?
About the mail --
Cover it?
What does it look like?
Well, then?
Take another look at these two.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Yes.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
His car's still there.
So what's wrong with that?
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
What?
You were magnificent.
Who was it?
Then let's spend some money.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
He can't stay up there.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Alex.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
Of course.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Yes, absolutely.
No.
I'm sorry.
Two hundred pounds?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
No.
It wasn't like that.
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
That guy, the one that died.
That one, last week.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
No.
Did he sound upset?
That sounds fine.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
That's okay too.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
Gee, that's very serious...
I gotta talk to you.
What kind of treatment?
Whatever you say.
Yes.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Let it ring.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
It isn't?
Hello.
I do her hair, yeah.
... yeah.
Gee, this is great.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Why?
You think that's funny, don't you?
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
I am not like my mother!
I am not!
Right, that's right.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Great.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Did Lester know about him?
Yeah?
You did, I know you did.
Yeah, baby...
What are you talking about?
-- what?
No you didn't.
You were great.
Nothing.
-- do you want ice?
-- well you better go after her.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Lester's on his way.
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
Don't go, Jackie...
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Otis is dead.
-- how did you get here?
Great, great. I hope you make it.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
What's gonna happen?
No shit?
What?
Do you really mean that?
Yeah, baby.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Okay...  Night, baby.
Great.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
A business meeting, I told you that.
Look at the way I live.
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I didn't want him meeting me here.
What is.
Let go of me.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
Jesus.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Did you?
What did you say?
Well, yeah.
Yes it is.
Sure.
Oh yeah?
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
What can I say!
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Okay, thanks.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
What about her?
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Yes I do.
What?
No.
I'll call you back.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
Is that right?
Steve?
Then you were talking to him.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Who is that?
George is great but I know what you mean.
Well, it's George.
But you have problems?
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Well, you know what I mean.
I'm exaggerating.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
What did you do?
-- sort of a boyfriend?
-- never mind.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
That's fine --
No.
No.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Come here for a minute, first.
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Do you like this hotel?
French Fries and Ketchup.
Okay, Mom.
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Okay, Mom.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Danny, come here!
Danny!
No.
Talking to Tony.
No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Do I have to?
Thank you.
Grady... oh.
I'm a Wendy.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Good.
What line of work are you in now?
Thank you for saying so.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Hmm, nice.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
No, nothing at all.
Yes, I did.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Jack...
Jack...
Wendy!
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Well, that sounds fine to me.
They'll love it.
Thank you, Susie.
Jane-
What's that?
For getting a divorce?
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
Rats...
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
What if it's some kind of monster?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
What the hell does that matter?
There! You see!
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
We won't!
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
What about crack?  You a user?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You can handle this.
Vince...
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
Yes, Betty?
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
That man -- who is he?
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
Whatever.
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
Mary Robert.
Again!
Five a.m.?
I... I...
A novice.
Excuse me?
What?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Keep moving!
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Again?
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
What?
You mean black people?
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
I'm outta here.
Your cell is more than adequate.
Come, Sister.
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
No.  No.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
Out of the question.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
He didn't do you a favor.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
How?
They open a window.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
Who are you guys?
Not... totally.
It didn't happen.
It didn't work, Vince.
So, take it off.
Really...
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
She's our inspiration!
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
A Benedictine.
Christy.
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
How did you hear this?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
What are you spying on?
Bring him.
What of it?
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Master Hardenbrook...
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Chosen me?
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
I know it.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
I did not ask you to, did I?
Up.
I have others.  All I need is this.
Man or woman?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
Baltus Van Tassel.
I doubt that's the end.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
What?
No, but... why do you ask that?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
Come with me.
And, what did he say?
What did he say, Katrina?
His horse.
Yes, actually.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Let her go!
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
I didn't see none.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Good to know you, Karl.
How are you, Bill?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
What you got that's good to eat?
French-fried potaters.
What you got in there, warshing?
Karl's my name.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
What do you want, hun?
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
I hate you!
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Yeah.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
All right then.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Two people.
I thought they was.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
Yeah, I recollect it.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
No sir.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
I'm glad of it, honey.
He ain't ever okay to me.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Yes, I guess you are.
You better go get your things.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Yes sir.
Right now?
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Ma'am?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
How long have you been standing here?
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
I reckon not.
Oh. How about before that?
Can I help you, sir?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
Why won't he talk to women?
Yes sir.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
American literature. What else?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
I'd love to.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
The Queen of England?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
Yeah, I did.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Yeah, probably.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
You're looking good, Auggie.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
It means "happiness."
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Yeah, like what?
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
What can I do for you?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
You mean Rashid?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
It was just a thought.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Is your father an artist?
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
How long have you been here?
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
The inspiration.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Here, catch.
Yeah, I picked it up.
That's it. In a nutshell.
It wasn't my fault.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
Yes, please.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Is that your third question?
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Well, it seems to me...
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
Easy.  Slow is best.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
Oh, in a heartbeat.
Objection!  Speculation.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
No, you don't.
You're wondering why I held it.
To my father.  Everything counts.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Fell.
Still lashed to the mast.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
It is.
Apparently.
I don't think so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Obviously.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
I can't speak for him.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Yes.  And that one, too.
I suppose you want a tip?
Get lost, will you?
It's private.  Go away.
Those two musicians from the garage!
Yeah.  Why?
Of course I am.
No we're not.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
I told you - it's a sure thing.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
We're not too late, are we?
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
Shave our legs, stupid.
You better come help me.
Polish?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Fight it.
Then pull the emergency brake!
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
And I'm not even pretty.
You - you -
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Have I got things to tell you!
I am.
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Like what?
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
Good night, honey.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
Isn't that ridiculous?
I have a very low resistance.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Come on, Daphne.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Oh - here and there - and around.
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
- and you got to be girls.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Goodbye?
Pleased to meet you.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
We won't breathe a word.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
We'll take it!
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
You're entitled.
Glasses?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Would you mind terribly?
Why?
Not at all.
Well, I'm not.
You're society girls?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
It's all right for a bachelor.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Talk about sad.
Is it that hopeless?
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Me?
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Big joke!
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
Spats Colombo.
Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Pub Golf?
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
Or Kat....
Why, with you.
Um, just about everyone.
Its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
I had to say something to get you here.
No.
And you do now?
No, tell me.
Hey, yourself.  I see youve met my ex.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Not for a dog.
Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
I slept with your sister.
Kat.
Youre too good for him.
Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Its my job.
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Of course, dont be silly.
Sometime, but not like this.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
I try...
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
Yes, mam...
What do that mean?
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
Yes, David...
Thank you, Josie Mae.
That's right!
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
Yes, mam...
He can't get up, Mama!
No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Little chilly.
Ike, you could make a song outta that!
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
My head hurts.
Eric!
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
I saw him last night!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
MPH RM!!!
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
MOM!!!
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
It isn't fair!
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
Huh?
Yes?
Oh God... What have I done...
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
You bet, Terrance!
I know, Terrance. I know.
Canada is saving us!!
You did? Just now?
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Yup.
Hi Stan.
Cool!
Oh Sara...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
It certainly is.
Very professional of you.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
It's a little late for you to be up.
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
That's right.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
Close every door behind you!
Ready as I'll ever be.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Taylor!  Where are you?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
And so far.
I don't know.  Wave to them!
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
He's in the bathroom.
Baby, take it easy.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
What are you going to do about it?
The engines!
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Find your bowler?
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
La da da dalala...
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
Theo.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
That game was before you was born.
She's my mom.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
The small ball.
You got a better offer?
He says that to all his wives.
I am underground.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a piata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
Buzz Fazeli.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
Look who's talking!
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
Now swing it out a little to the right...
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Where can I find him?
Whips...orange whips.
What do you want with my dad?
Won't your father help you with that?
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
No, I'm fascinated.
Sheila, please.
What's plan C?
You got any broken bones?
Why not?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
Tell me what happened Theo.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
Suck my dick!
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Please, Dr. Levine.
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
What if it attacks?
What do we use for defense?
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
He's right beneath us.
What?
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
How drastic?
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Jerry?
Working on it now, sir.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Harry?  Can you copy?
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
They've left, keep watching!
In a minute, sir.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
What -- you want me to retype it?
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
Too big?
I love secrets.
That's quite a secret.
Get this thing off me.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Beth.
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
Where did you get this?
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You don't trust me?
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
Fixing it.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
We must've had it delivered then.
What?
Valdomet.
How do you spell it?
Causes sleep.
How long does it last?
You want to kill him?
I'm feeling better.
You tell me.
Don't you?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
No, he isn't.
No, he can't.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
It's either this... or I kill you.
It's not safe for you to be either.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
C'mon --
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
I never said that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Just in time for what?
We can refuse to talk.
I'm fine.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Then what, Norman?
What are they?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
What happened to her?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
I thought she was with you.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
Shut up and open the door.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
No idea.
Wait!
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
What is it, Harry?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Please.  It must have flown here --
You mean you don't know?
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
Could I learn to feel it?
How can you store an energy field within you?
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
Yes, sir.
I'll make a report later.
Was this trip really necessary?
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
Why didn't you say so before.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Move out of the way!
Come back here... Where are you going?
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
See Threepio!  Do you copy?
I'd consider it an honor.
It's what I deserve.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
What do I want with a scar ?
Death to all bugs !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Not enough, I guess.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
Your father will never let you.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
A funeral.
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
I have good reflexes.
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
I'll go for that.
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
I like it. It's kinda...you.
How are you, Carl ?
Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Sure.
You saying you didn't ?
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Looks like rain.
I won't quit !
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
AAAAAAAAAAA !
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
No, sir.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Uh, I don't know.
Good for you. Go find out.
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
You may proceede.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
The information will not be disclosed.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
That is how V'ger will survive.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
It's taken control of the computer...!
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
Captain... I'd like to go along...
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
I want him here.  Sit down!
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Any reply from them?
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Mr. Decker... ?
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Tractor beam remains constant...
I need a typewritter.
I beg your pardon?
Why did you quit?
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
Yes.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
It was either that, or a sardine.
No, no, I see...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Mmm.
What are you doing?  I love your script.
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Why?
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
I can't get it to come out right.
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
I'd love to.
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Not without a rolltop desk.
But that's what happened.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
I'm going to tell the truth.
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Courthouse back in town.
Hi.
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
And I need a drink.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
...they run on water.
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
This horse is booked.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
She wasn't in the...
Nothing happened.
I don't eat vegetables.
Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
We've got three days to...
I'm ready!
Mr. Barrenger.
It's night.
Mr. Bailey.
Then what is the...?
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
I...I...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
We, we have to give it.
The minute I read that script I said...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
Well.
Main Street.
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
My wife just went into labor...
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
I hurt my finger.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
No.
There's no witnesses...
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Is he cool or angry?
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
And we're glad to have you here...
It takes all kinds.
...we can't lose the wind...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I don't care.
I hate when you say that.
...why do you think?
Then why are you putting on mascara?
She is but an arriviste.
Great.
Don't. Take me with you.
I'm not.
Yes.
Thank God for that!
That's so weak.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
Cos she loves you.
No.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Is that like Luigi's?
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Pray.  We never find out.
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Rache says it's from you.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Let's take our best shot.
Have you still never told him?
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Remarried.  There is no move.
You think I didn't get that?
We're not discussing your age.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Don't do this.
To make it easier for them or you?
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
We're going to win this.
I live or I die.
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
Don't flatter yourself.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
...it's my problem, too.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Is that what he told you?
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Give 'em my number.
Aw.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
No, there isn't.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Rache, it may take time.
It's no biggie.
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Oh.
He was in a concentration camp?
Thank you.
Great to be here.
We had to work. My family was poor.
He's dead.
I am sure.
For rape and murder.
OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
What?
Got a lot of homework?
Huh?
You mean, again?
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You know he hated my story also.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Sure, Dad.
Uh huh.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
No.
Take off your top.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Again!
Any books you like to read for fun?
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Thanks.
I know.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
So where'd you get in?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Well get someone down there!
Used to Filmore, used to.
There's the fence...
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
I don't want any...
He's in there...
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Oh, yes, that's right.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Didn't they tell you?
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
What kind of trouble?
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Yes, sir.
Condition Red!
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
Just a squirt.
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
I presume the planes are armed?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Admiral Buldike?
They're coming in now.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Naturally I am, sir.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Maximum ECM!
Sure, I'll take her up right now.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Some kind of signaling.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
He's dead.
Sorry, King.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Let me check.
Roger.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
I don't anymore.
Yeah.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Yeah, when's he coming?
What's it about?
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
Where are you-hoo?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
The dude wants it.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
No, I mean, no one.
No, no.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Buff...
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Guess not.
Yeah, right, publicist.
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Hey.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Glad it's okay.
Please.
Hey, thanks, man.
I'll be in the car, okay?
Hi.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
He is.
Mm.
It's a mistake to think that.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Sooze wants to see him.
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
No.
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
Oh, shit.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Just go home, alright?
Will you just put the gun down?
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Is that Bee-Bee?
You could've come over.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
So you can give me more shit?
What? What do you stand for?
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Tim!
And?
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
You do.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
God, you smell like whiskey.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
Oh, yeah.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Well, what about this?
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
What are you saying?
It's stupid.
Oh, yeah?
It's pretty exciting.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
That was so great!
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
I can't believe you're still here.
If...
Yep.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Nobody's fucking anybody!
Where do you get your ideas?
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
I'm here.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Come on, Jeff.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
It's twins!!
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Wayne Gretzky.
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
No...I've been pregnant.
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
Y'think?
Trix...
Mmm-hmmm...
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Well, I want to know what happened --
We're here for you, Diane.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
Or, I could get my own horse...
Hold on...
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Now how the hell can I help you?
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
I didn't mean to --
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Hi, Artie.
Where's the bar?
What's wrong with it?
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
As for instance?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Into what? A lampshade?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
You're tough, all right.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
It will?
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
This is where you live?
Whose house is it?
Come on, Joe.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
It's a good script, isn't it?
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
It is not.  Get out.
Why?
Uh-huh.
This is fascinating.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
I'll take care of that.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
I've lost my car.
Who?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
Where are your...?
Good night.
Good.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Go on in.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Good.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
She is upstairs.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
That's right.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Frankly, no.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
No?
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
You know better than to interrupt me.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
You don't like me? You hate me?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Well...I guess one is all right.
But why?
Miss what?
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
She has hostages.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
Hmmm?
I did.
What an adorable hat.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
Theories?
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
As brave as my father. As wise.
Must've been a defective puck.
But what for?
It was just a trim.
You sure?
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
I'd love to.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
I know.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
Better than when I was a child.
Zaltar!
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
What? What did you tell me?
Brad.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
I seem to be.
You thought that?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
There's a lot of choices here.
No, thanks.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
We get together sometimes.
Sure.
Mmmmm . . .
What are you doing?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
Who gets it, the company?
So where is all them half-centses?
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
That what they call you?
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
Fair's fair.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
We gonna crash?
And do what?
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
But the bridge...
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Where's the handle?
Hello.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
Today coffee----
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Yeah. I'll check.
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
She'll be fine.
Really?
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Lois, I . . .
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Never closed my eyes.
I'm sorry.
You're not selfish at all.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Uh...home...
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
Good. My heart can't take it.
It's beautiful.
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
He ran in fear from us . . .
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
What about here?
Like me?
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
. . . And  very nave!
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
A toupee that flies?
But why the hair?
You're just an experiment, freako!
Ready, Uncle Lex?
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
First, I have fun.
What do you fear?
I am master now.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Bunkers!
Nobody else.
He's thirty-five years old.
We're running out of smoke.
One of them should've been you.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I know.
North. It's north
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
Jealous? Of what?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
I read the article.
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
I know...
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
I'm wearing it.
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
He sure as heck does that.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
-- as we will be.
He'll be weightless.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
He is. Usually.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Right on the first guess.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
Thirty-five.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Very much.
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
It's a Twinkie, boss.
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Which one?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Alison.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Why are you telling me this?
Okay.
Why?
Billy, please.  The children.
How?
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
No.  It should be dry by now.
When the game's over, I guess.
Sure.
Well I don't.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
From what?
You talked about it?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
I did.
Yes.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
Well, winter's far behind us now.
Yes.  It's a present.
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Did he say what about?
Oh.
You hate that.
Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
Was the bus on time?
Will you be spending more than a night?
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
Tell me about it.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
Is there shrimp on it?
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Yes.
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Yes.
Why were you scared?
No.
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Very slick.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
Yeah, right.
The Ottos.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Alone or surrounded?
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Hurry back.
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Did Sidney tell you about it?
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
No...
Now don't kid a kidder.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Can I come in for a minute?
Not just this minute, J.J....
I don't?
When?
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
I read your column every day...
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
But not for anything I did today...
She knows now.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
- He's got them on him.
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
At the bar - Sidney...
Hello.
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
He wants me to break a leg?
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Take a top coat.
It is a favor, isn't it?
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
Let me try mine.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
You told me to.
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Why?
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Why attack Russia?
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Relax now, Sarah --
I don't know.
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
Eating is eating... and...
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Why not show Dr. Furtwngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
Furtwngler's in a different category.
Yes.
Three months.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
What is this, Emmi?
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Yes, von der Null.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
And what did he say?
What?
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Of course I know what that is.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
How could I forget?
So. You wanted to see me.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Right. Claims assessor.
Come to the office, please.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Great.
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Kyle.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Why?
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
You must have had a fun child-
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
No.  I'm not.
It's better that way.
Yes.
Who is in authority here?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Did you?  Kudos.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
It was an accident.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Why... ?
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
I don't...
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
Scams, con games.  How many?
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
Stop talking to them!
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Boyfriend?
Underwear?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Elizabeth?
Okay.
I'll call them, okay?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
Really?
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
I'll call.  I really will.
What kind of vacation?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
Like, this way... sort of...
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Is there a room key?
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Fine.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
No.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
It was a misunderstanding.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
You're joking.
Attempted murder.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
Sure.
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
And that will be a good place to end this study.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
No.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
Yes.
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Test it.
Good.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Nell, what do we do?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
No one will come any nearer than that.
It's all I could afford.
I don't know what you mean.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Then let's go get you one.
Then what good is he?
It's not a knock.
Why?
Oh, god.
Why not?
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
We'll find him.
Let him break - he likes to break.
I wouldn't talk.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Eduardo.  Rama.
Huh?
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
No one else is even here yet.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Probably.
No, but I know what he means.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Not embarrassed.
Not ashamed.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Why not.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
What about your grandmother?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
Up the coast.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Where else?
Good luck.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Are you finished?
Who's looking for you?
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
No. Uh... family friend.
I don't understand.
That right.
That'll be fine.
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
How's that?
You don't have to--
Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
...OK.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
I took Doris's keys.
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Oh, hell. Drink?
Sure you don't need one?
So, who should I--
I'm fine. Thanks.
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
Yeah.
What the hell are you talking about?
He's the dead guy.
Hello, Walter.
Homicide.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Great.
Anything missin'?
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Where's the walk-in safe?
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
You said the system couldn't fail!
You're kidding.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
Not so loud.
I don't believe it.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
Look who's here, Margo.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Read it out loud.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Big as a house.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Get back!  Now!
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Quiet.
Another storage room.
What's that?
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
I don't understand.
Gone.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
I can't!
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
All prop cars accounted for?
Why would we--
Do it!
A window onto the human condition?
Certainly a nomination.
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
Truman, you're gonna be late!
It's a surprise.
Gee, that's great.
Oh, my God!
Put some butter on it--or ice?
I think I'd like a little company.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
When you get to Fiji?
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
Were you there--how do you know?
You're not FBI agents.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Yes.
Yes. I know.
Nothing completely conclusive --
Yes.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
Looking for him for what?
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
Do you?
Not according to the men in blue.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Where are you, Scully?
Did you find something?
What's wrong, Scully?
No you didn't.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
No.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
I can't really talk right now.
Evidence of a massive infection.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
I don't know, Mulder.
This is great. This is fitting.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
Just like that --
I don't know anything about that.
About what?
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
Where's Scully?!
I'm not taking any chances.
I've got to find Scully.
I have answers for you.
About the conspiracy?
I want to know where Scully is.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
How?
What about you?
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Lucien Baines?
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
Okay.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
No.  No.
What's wrong?
I don't need them anymore...
Give a kiss to Edward.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
You don't know the procedure.
Peter, okay?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
I did, yeah.
Then what is he?
If you believe that.
Little boy?!  That's him!
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
Absolutely.  Abigail...
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
You're kidding me.
I think that's the whole point.
I'll get her...
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Awaiting his arrival.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
It's his dog.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
Next time, tell me, okay?
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Give her some cigarettes.
They think you did it.
Do you understand German?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
Yes.
They're forged.
Just another part I've got to learn.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Tell me more.
It's just what he used to say.
What are you going to do?
Why?
A parrot...Let it go.
How did you know I would be here?
His.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
I don't know.
No, not yet.
Fellow called Lime.
Martins.
No.
Once in a while.
Best thing that ever happened...
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
A bruised lip.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
I'm not asking you to.
Thank you. Excuse me.
How about the doorway?
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
This way, miss.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
I'll look it up for you.
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
What about?
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Why not?
What do you want?
Here?
What did he say?
But you will.
I have guests waiting.
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
You don't mean that doctor?
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
Never.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Help you out?
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Traveler.
I don't think so.
That's the wrong one.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
So how many miles do you think it is?
What!
Yes.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
Hi there. Here, take a look.
No.
Where did you lose it?
So?
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They sound like you.
Then I won't bring you....
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I have a job.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
Then how come you're talking to me?
Why won't you talk to me?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Why not?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Do they?
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
And be crushed.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
What about Curtis Zampf?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Of course they're Jews.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
The arguments, anyway.
To hear them read Torah.
Fucking kike.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Who told you that?
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
What...?
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Where?
JTS...?
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
Why me?
I was a Jew in a previous life.
What are you trying to say?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Do I give a shit?
I was just trying to make a point. If --
Eat shit....
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
What d'you mean?
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
You know what I'm talking about.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Lira?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
What does that mean?
Then tell him to wax it too.
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
I didn't say...  Brussels!
Yes, I know.
What room have you got?
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
... You married?
... For the mermaids.
Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
... I'm listening.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
Thank you, thank you very much!
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Who?
I don't know... why?
Thank you...
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
It's me... Johana.
I'm still here.
No... tell me.
... Not at all.
You'll understand.
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
... Are you sure?
No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
Louis, we were French!
No.  I'm just depressed.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Let him sleep.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
What do you want me to do?
C'mon follow me.
Yeah, no kidding.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
Mordechai!
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Why not?
I don't know -
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
What do you want to see him for?
Let me see it 
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Good evening.
I want to ask you something.
No. I'm quite sure.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
We're old friends.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Yeah.
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
I know. Funerals.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
You. Us.
If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?
No!
You bastard...
You splendid bastard...
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
What are you doing? You cant. I...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Yeah.
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnt I hear you right?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
Its up to you whether they walk or not.
Yeah.
Yes... Good, good...
Tomorrow?
What...?
Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
...On holiday?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...
Got it. Puppies.
No.
La what?
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!
Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.
Recommended?
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
When... Im told he came here...
My rates...
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.
Jah...
Does it matter?
Is my money in there?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
Should I come back in five minutes?
Have you?
An Austrian.
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
How are you, Rhian?
Should I be?
Can I get up now?
Im afraid I dont understand.
Er... Yes...
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
No...
I... How long have I been here?
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
What about his girlfriend?
Fucked-up fucking weird.
O est pass ton salon?
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Fuck...
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Cost what?
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
My lord, I'm not sure that...
Majesty, I can't...
Yes, my lord.
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Now?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Yes...
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
You make it sound so simple...
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
To marry you.
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
It would not be the same without you.
Not yet!
But... why... what's the point?
I want to stay with you...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
Performing a miracle.
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
We want her burned as a witch!
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Where... where am I?
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
Yes.
No... I want to be confessed.
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
Buying her?
I understand.  How much?
You think?
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
But... her army's so small now...
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
Go and ask him yourself.
20,000 gold crowns.
He's on the other side of the river.
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
Not yet.
Yes, it's a miracle.
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Damn right!
But the bridge has been pulled down!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
The clothes are not important...
No...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Why not?
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
What are you doing on the wall?
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
Whose were they?
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
How will we sleep?
What, I'm working, what?
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
Yes, that's why I brought it.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
I was listening, Kitten.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Stop it, Wladek.
Not yet.
Watch his hand
It will be very dramatic.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
No, no bible readers.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
On your property?
The piano.
Yes, I thought that.
No.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Spoken words?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
They are washed.
What happened?
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
On your piano, that is the swap.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
Don't worry about it, pal.
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
They workin' for anybody?
What about the other one?
Hackers.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
You mean you blew it.
I never played for winos.
If we ever get to it.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
He threatened to kill me.
Did he hold you up on anything?
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Raise 500.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
But I got a train to make.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
2:00 A.M.
Yeh, sleepin'.
You move right along, don't ya.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
He cheats.
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
I am after this race.
I'm in.
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
For fifteen years.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He'll never do it.
Come on, gimme a break.
No.
He was?
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
Do you think I care
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
You're talking like a crazy person,
Oh, Andy, Andy!
Give it to me.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Shush!
Now do you believe me!
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
You see how much we have to say.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
Where are you going?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Man to man, I'm not.
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
What do you mean?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
He did!
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Never mind.
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
Go ahead!
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
You're going to return every cent of it!
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Good.
That's all right.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
But suppose some business comes up...
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Hello, baby.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Much better, thanks.
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Can't you get to sleep?
They were kidding you.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Who's that?
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
It was his body that was buried there.
Got a nice evening dress?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
It's the only way it makes sense.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
Oh, God.
No, please, not again.
We're going to keep driving.
Wha...
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
So we wait.
What am I supposed to do?
What about the gold?
Then get up and do something about it.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
I told you; don't push me around.
Why'd he come in our camp.
He's an enemy soldier.
We're at war.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
I've got no stomach for murder.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
And let me guess who is.
We thought--
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
Knock it off!
There might be something in there.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Wh-what do you think--
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
Millionaires, man.
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I heard it click.
Just be cool.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Shut up and listen!
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
It's giving.
Is it dead?
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
We'll find our way.
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
Sure.
Makes two of us.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Don't you touch it.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
I don't have a weapon.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
With what?  Against how many?
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
The...the gold...
Thanks.
How the hell should I know?
He's going to slow down.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
I could use some recon photos too.
The photos.
Okay.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Now you need me.
I could.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
How the hell should I know how much?
You know what I'm doing with my half?
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Permant cortex bond.
What happened?
4732...?
What's the matter with you?
Don't be so sure.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
Don't take anything.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
But...you...
I don't know.
No one can see us now we're alone.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
We're leaving.
Impossible!
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
Why are you so concerned?
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
Look!
Look more closely.
What?
I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
No?
No......  She's dead THX........
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Where...?
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
`Til we get a better lead.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
What?
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Be right back.
Stay to your left.
I don't know.
No excuses, just do it!
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
It's from an IRA.
"Punks", huh?
Helluva fuck factor.
Take him!
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
A ticking bomb...
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Look, it's important.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Report on the case so far.
Yes, sir.
I know.
erect in sweater, arms folded.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
About tonsils.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
Amsterdam?
You've never been in Constantinople?
Nice suit.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
No, not at all!
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
What is it?
M'sieu Monescu!
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
I would like to.
Why should you?
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
No, thank you.
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Gaston Monescu.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Seven and nine!
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Certainly!
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Lily-- 
Lily!
Yes.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
No. What is it? Tell me.
That sounds sensible. 
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
You're hired!
Hair?
Talk? About me--about us?
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
So you think you can get me?
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I know it.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
I don't believe it!
Yes--uh--
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
How much is your salary?
He started it.
Well, he was in the navy.
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
But you saw it here.
That's right.
Thank you, Rose.
Hurry, Rose.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Lewis...
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
Rose Calvert.
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Bollocks.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
If only it were that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
I see you.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
This is crazy.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
He couldn't have.
I'll be right back.
We'll find out.
I'm so cold.
That's enough.
Would you like anything?
Just tell us what you can --
Charmed, I'm sure.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Goodbye, mother.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Sure!
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I'll join you later.
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Glad to see you again.
That's a date. 
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
I don't understand.
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
We'll be expecting you.
Not at all.
And me coming in with two pair-- 
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Sure!  Excuse me.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
I'll say she is!
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Good-by!
You work too fast for me, young man.
Well, I can't.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
You said it! How about a little action?
Good night, idiot!
I thought you were a smart guy.
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
I'll watch for him, sir.
You take some awful chances.
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
It's a pleasure.
Much better--thank you--
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Back is in New York.
No. <U>Knots</U>!
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Like it?
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
Do what--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
The country boy's about due.
Thanks to me.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I sincerely hope so--
What's the matter?
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Now Ed, are we cross?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Maybe even my destiny.
Absolutely nothing.
Well I'm not so go home.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Excuse me?
But wait, you don't understand-
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Enough?  Never.
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
I'll remember you said that.
How you feelin', Doc?
All right.  Then what?
Sorry...
What?
Good God, you're really-
I laugh sometimes
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
Getting late.  We better get back.
I didn't mean it that way.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
All right, well, good night.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Morg, use your head.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Yeah.  It's a fact.
But she doted on the frowner
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
I can feel your pain.
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Do you?
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Hey - the world is my office.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Interesting video tape.
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
I hope so.
What?
He was my father's best friend!
You are seriously deranged.
Up.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
If not?
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
Of course.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
Sabotage?
Stop it!
Captain Morton.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Approaching the first gate.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
Yes. Shall we kill them?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
They're too big.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
Like muddy waters?
You were in hell?
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
Everything these days is made overseas.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
You should go back and rest.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Let me get you a cup?
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
I already have, my dear.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
What's a toby?
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
You know the man next door is near death.
Oh, yeah!
You can bring ONE toy...
No, I haven't seen him.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Mm-hmmmmm.
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
But why would Andy want me?
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
What?!
Look out!!
Hold still, Buzz!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
What's with him?
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Did I get my package in the mail?
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Uh-oh.
Huh?
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Speed up!
But you're Irish!
Excuse me.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
I finished it off.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
In my pocket.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
All the time.
We're too young.
You're late for breakfast.
It's all right, Finn.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
Nine thousand dollars.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
Arnie, thank God.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Barbara --
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
I don't know.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Just watch.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Then here's a little bump.
Nope.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
Not Tiger Woods.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
That thought makes me feel awful.
You're breaking my heart.
So go shower already.
Yes, sir!
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
I don't believe you.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Yeah.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
What?
Where?
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
Noriega is a criminal.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
What do you look for?
Just tell me where she is.
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Bit fucking late, like.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
You've stabbed me, man.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
What?
Out.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Are you clean?
Too young for what?
So why have you told me about it?
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
It's an interesting theory.
Aye.
Right.
Nightmare.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Lewis Gilbert.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
What about The Untouchables?
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Stick it on my tab.
As you wish.
Such as?
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
So what's it going to be?
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
If we could send a distress signal...
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Put it on the screen.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
I don't understand.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Fascinating.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
Yes, Captain.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If you think it would help.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
I have a half brother.
Is what possible?
Not possible. You were never alone.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
Because you, too, must know.



  

No. I will not.
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
You haven't told him?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Hi, Flynn.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
I'm certainly not.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Yes, okay, exactement!
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
If you think -
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
It can be arranged...
Hah.
No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
It's too far!
Probably.
Shhhhh.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
How 'bout yourself?
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
Do it!
Then I owe you some thanks...
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Yeah, Dad.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
What?
Here, check these out.
Right.  She's only fourteen.
I thought you moved out.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Stay on him.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Yeah, but for who?							*
The purse is still at the house.
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
But you didn't.  Why not?
I'd like that.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
No.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
Answer the question--
Do you still love your husband?
Yes or no.
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Yup.										*
God, you have great legs.
Yes.
No.  Much more.
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
What about the husbands?
Those idiots.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
He said he was an American agent.
Fuck you.
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
Yes.  Now go.
I'm married!
I don't know.  I have to think...
I just glances inside.
Find out who this Renquist it.
Don't eat anything.
Get it.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Is that your real name? Really?
I took a cab.
Sure. Why not?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
What do you do?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
You will?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
That rhymes.
Take that shit somewhere else.
You wanna get unhaunted?
I don't blame you.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
She's with me.
No thanks.
You got it.
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Good for you.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
I know.
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Elliot.
Elliot Blitzer.
Where?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
Want an animal cracker?
Look, Dick, I don't -
What department?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
I can see what you mean.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
That's about all I ever eat.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
She seems very nice.
You were a cop.
No shit?
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
Step inside.
Thank you.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Sure was.
Or a supporting actor -
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
How the fuck could he know?
How's he supposed to see the wire?
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
- Because it's good!
What can I do?
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Uh, I didn't hear the...
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
You're still a little... disoriented.
And your only goal is...???
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
No.
You wouldn't understand.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
No, 1995 is the past.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
What?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
It was?  I didn't...know.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
Hey, man...
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
Yes, sir.
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
You want something?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What do you want for free?
Think you'll live that long?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
I need a ticket.
Out of here.
I don't care, just get me there.
Harlin around?
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Open up!
Let me have a Beck's.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
What does it look like?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
I just drove in this morning.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
I have ideas.
You know what I want.
You could just leave him.
You live pretty good.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
Stop it.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
What was I supposed to do?
There has to be!
What about him?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Funny thing.
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
Just drive.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
I'm her husband.
A lot that means.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Like you don't know.
No.
No.
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
You're talking like a mad man.
What makes you say that?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Trouble with the car again?
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
You came to take my wife from me?
Liar.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
I said come on!
You're too quick for me.
For what?
Will you shut up!
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Not before I settle with you.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Oh, shit!
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
What for?
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
You want something?
Christ!
That's 'cause he's dead.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
You broke my nose!
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I did?
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
And what does that make you?
You love her, but you hate her?
How do you want it?
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
Oz.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Yep.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You've been there?
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Eh?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
What happened to your hand?
No trouble at all, really.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
I just drove in this morning.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
What?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Yeah.
There is no us, remember?
Stop it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
Sure, I'll try.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Like you helped her, Jake?
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
I want my lawyer!
Oh.
You've made a considerably wise decision.
I have a lock on the door.
What does that mean?
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Yes.
Jesus.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
In college. A car accident.
What was your idea Elijah?
You're skill.
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
What's he look like?
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
I won't make any noise.
I'll help you.
Is that right?
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
Okay.
No.
How did you get together?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
And what was that explanation?
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
What wife? He don't have no wife.
You ain't dead.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
But he was called...
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Give it to him.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
I could of... easy.
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Huh?
Well... I don't recollect.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
You missed him? You didn't...?
After a ways.
You still think he's in there?
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Tell me right off if you see him.
I can't see 'em.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
Yeah.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
Yeah.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
You ain't like that no more.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
How far kin you see?
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Two.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
What?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
Yeah?
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
They ruined me tonight.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I don't want to know.
You are a criminal.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
If you'll just let me -
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Not if we do it my way.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
Who's your boss?
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
We'll see.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
Tell him we'll meet.
Two hours, tops.
Which is shit.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
You know damn well what I think.
I know he was good.
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
This is totally irrelevant.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Why didn't you say anything?
Wait a minute.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Edie.
Because he was my friend.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Nothing.
Very good.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
It looks that way.
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
What does it mean?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
...I was one of a group of...
Yes.
That's right.
Well, we...
Yes.
...We did everything we could...
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Objection.
Nothing further, your Honor.
You may step down.
I wouldn't do it.
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I completely understand ...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
The Doctors were not negligent.
That's what I'd planned to...
...What difference would...
No, you did fine.
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Yes.  I wrote it.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
Nothing happened.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
Why is that?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
My client can't walk, your Honor.
Thank you for seeing me.
That happens.
Ready, your Honor.
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
How come you're calling me from...?
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
What...?
I've got to work.
You're going to stay here...?
What is that to you...?
No...no...
No.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's not in, Sir.
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
What do you want?
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
The broad has disappeared...
We got to talk.
It's locked.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... You saw her?
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
In New York?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
We, we were rather busy...
Should I?
Yes.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
Then?
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
That's Carlotta Valdes.
But you knew about this.
Did she hurt herself?
Do you live here in the hotel?
Why?
Let me come in.
But you haven't lived here long.
No, you don't owe me anything.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Ah, no!
Yes.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
No...
At...
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
Oh! Yes! Here!
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
No! No, thank you!
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
Madeleine!
Here with you.
Home?
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Yes?! But --
I love you too... too late... too late...
Yes... you run this hotel.
How long has she had the room?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
More than you think.
It's where you belong.
Uh-huh!
Normal.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Sorry, old man. Work.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
That!?!
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Yeah.
Who?
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
You haven't told me everything.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Where?
Oh?
Don't touch her. Call 911.
I didn't hear you.
First of all...
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
Playing?
You're not a team player.
You want to hear me out?
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
You don't know what you're doing.
Calling the ambulance.
There's more.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Sure, why not.
So I didn't fucking do it!
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
What?
We've already done this.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
I can't do this.
There is no candy!
I know...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
I got you.
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sweet deal.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Left side.
What is her disposition?
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
I can't.
Nobody knows.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Good God...Good God...
He's having a problem here.
He is not cracking up.
What is the question you asked me?
What you just said. Say it again.
Yeah.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Fine? Fine what?
I'm serious.
You're sick.
It's my fucking opinion.
I love you.
I do.
How could I know what else I forgot?
What?
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
Why? What's his problem?
Of course.
Problems?
What kind of seats can we have?
We're leaving in three hours.
Of course.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well I do.
Nesting?
I'm mad at you.
No. Just like an hour or so.
Okay.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Do you love me?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
But...
What money?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
You did all right dad.
He's your brother.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Greenpeace?
My God...
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
A mutant species.
That's our plan.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
You'd like me to kill them?
What's that?
What about them?
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Don't you ever see him?
Evil.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
She won't even know.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
That's it.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
Are you Jorge?
Leave him alone.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
I'll be ready.
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Things seem to be getting better.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Stop this!
Where?
A black bull came.
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
This louse is looking for trouble.
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
When you are, miss.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
I have a headache.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
I've seen worse.
Where's my gun?
You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
On my life, I promise you I will.
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Got it.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
I'M WHAT?!
I understand... I understand perfectly.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
Do I get to see it or not?
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Talk so I can understand.
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
All my work is my finest.
Of course you are.
Help me get out of here.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
I know who would know.
Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
This isn't a game, Parker!
I'm doing the best I can!
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
You don't know?
Duck!
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
For Schumann.
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
Indeed it is.
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
No, no, no...
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
What rig?
What are you talking about?
Who's got the story? 
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
I'll see you at National.
....we landing?
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
What's it gonna cost? 
Who would find out?
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
The Hostages...?
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does <u>Moss</u> want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the <u>file</u>, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
Fine. 
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
...how ya feeling, boy?
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
When's he coming back...?
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
Why Albania?
...going to War...
...that's what it is.
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
...it's a Teaser!
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
All the greater accomplishment.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Might, if I was asked... 
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
...but...
No.  You're right.
Watch me.
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
It's too clean.
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...  Gemme the Pentagon.  List of people in all Military Special Programs.... Left behind.  Like the Old Shoe... Johnny: "Good Old Shoe"... 
See y'at the Finish Line.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...
I believe in you....
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
I'm just talking about the Hats.
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
...of kittens...
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
...gotta read my reports.
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Then get out and close it behind you.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Coulda been a contender.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
Alright. Why so pissed?
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
What'd you tell him?
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
What? How do you know about my father?
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
How much is enough Gordon?
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Upper West Side.
Break it.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
Yeah, almost...
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
Why?
Any better and I'd be guilty.
...how do you know? You wish...
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
With Mark?
Businessman!
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
No?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
They seemed, closing by much 
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Right behind you.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Well divide 18 into three
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
They're all human beings
You guys are being real assholes
I'll come back all the time.
What do you mean?
A ghost?
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Mm-hmm.
How do you know it's a she?
Nope.
Do you?
Have you been hurt?
Who's that?
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Um...sure.
It's fine.
...just so she could cut them off.
I came in from my room...
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Stop.
She's making this up.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Yep.
...no...no...no...
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Did I?
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
I was down in Adamant...
What are you going to do?
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
I know.
Yep.
Three o'clock.
Not the focus.
Of him I think.
That's not what I'm sug--
Mmnph.
Is it gone?
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
What kind of whispering?
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
No.  Look!  In the window.
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Harvey says he's amazing.
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Sweetheart--
Claire, please...
Yep.
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Stop...
Wouldn't go that far.
Since when?
Who?
STOP IT!
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
Huh.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Shhhh.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
Michael, Rowan should -
Nothing was ever more false.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Then you wear it.
I had you sent away.
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
Better than most, I suppose.
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
ENOUGH!!!
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
FAST.
Lie...?
It is from love.
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
Go away!  I don't want you here.
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
I know.    you are my son -
Rowan...
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
Rowan...
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
You still feel that crazy...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Captain's orders.
All I meant was -
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Hello..
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
No.    This is unreal...
Talking to me dear...?
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
What were you talking about...?
Gotcha.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Stop it!
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
The one on the left - definitely...
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
CHIC MAGAZINE?
Yes it is...
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
And how many people have you killed?
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
Why should I?
STEPHANIE?
Open it...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
I am sorry...
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
You killed my friend!
It's what you would do to me
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
Don't worry about it -
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Oh...
I'll be sure to...
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
Were you always this sick?
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Yeah, whatever.
What is it now?
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
So you'll think about it?
Yeah? You like?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
You have changed since second grade.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We own a small family grocery store.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
Dad, please.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
...not the pit.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Whatever you want.
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
I understand.
Most places are, Jimmy.
You want it in writing?
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
I meant biologically.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Yellow pages?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Like what?
Forget the store. Think big.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
Of course I like girls.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
Tipping?
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
Me? The King of Coitus?
I was like a different person tonight.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
Really? You'd do that for me?
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
That's perfect.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
My job. Back off, Benedict.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
Eat a power bar.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
What about the blood?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
He was large?
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
No.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
You could tell me where you were last night.
Back to the land of grownups.
Lombardo's settlement?
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
We don't know that, Ray...
Ray, you heard him...
Where's Lombardo?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
So you were alone.
Did he come in with you?
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Yeah... okay... he did
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
I said he did.
I'm sorry?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Lombardo ever come out here?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
I think we just need to get wasted.
Curiosity, I guess.
I'm not on your property!
No you don't.
In back of the garage.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
About six and a half million dollars.
Hello.
Okay.  I love you too.
What's that supposed to mean?
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
Just like that?
That's right.
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
You can't...
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
We?
Can't.  Got a passenger.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Shit. Here we go again.
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Jim West.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
You need that real often?
I'll work on it.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
All what?
I'm going to hit you.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Of course not.
Thank you.
What is this?  A whole new train?
We'll see.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
My... the wild west.
I don't like to lose, either.
You tell me.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
My friend?
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Yes sir.
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Dr. Loveless?
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Yes!
They're coming.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
You're not going to use it, are you?
Right.
Then come with us.
What is Tir Asleen?
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
I don't believe you.
Madmartigan.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Why.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Absolutely!
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Who?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
The limitless power of...
His will.
More!  More!
Courage, Willow.
Somebody has to do it.
Me neither!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Cows. You know, cows?
Not one this big.
They're Amish.
No pistol. Ever.
...I want to say a thing.
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Oh, he's good.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Hochmut?
Oh. The bullets.
A real fireball.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
But... You may not be well enough.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Johnny, what the fuck?
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
You are acting like one!
My son is out there!
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
If any!
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Oh ....
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Oh!
Hickory!
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Uh-huh.
Oh, you....
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Did you say something?
My mouth -- my mouth!
Well, you're perfect now.
Oh --!
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh! Oh!
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
No, but you tried to.
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Hah!
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Oh, come on.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Ah --
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
It did?
Who at?
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Imposserous!
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Yeah.
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
No, sir!
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
We'll get you together!
Oh --
Well, I --
Well, I --
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.
With this?
Then its no longer a bomb?
Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Elektra would control it all.
Like riding a bike.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
The inside man?
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Indeed.
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I have to go.
I have to go to work.
Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
He used your exact words.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Whats your business with Elektra King?
No!  Get me out!
How appropriate.
Is it?
Of course...
Still no contact yet.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Jon -- what??
Veidts complex.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
The missing scientists.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
And what if youre wrong?
What if youre wrong??
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
Okay!
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
The costumes.  Am I right?
Yes you are.
That's because --
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
I don't think she's coming with us.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
-- What?
I don't know their real names!
Am I free to go?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Maybe I'll do that.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Looks like a diner.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
He gets to be the hero.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Go to the water, it's that way!
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Nice place to start, don't you think?
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
What's the deal?
Been to any good diners lately?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
Had to do what I had to do.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
Into the Hudson?
What if they're naughty?
He's busy right now.
Were you now?
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
Deal.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
I'll go.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Yes, my dear, he is.
You have the wrong house.
No!
Poppycock!
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
I did, sir.
Yes, sir.
Baack!
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
I...
Of course.
Yes.
I promise.
You're incorrigible!
Goodbye, darling.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
May I have it, please?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
Will there be anything else?
A week.  Ten days at most.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Yes, sir.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
A piece of what?
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
Fron kon steen!
I'm sure we will.
How do you do?
Yes, just the two.
What hump?
No.
I wonder what's got into them?
What?
Could be raining!
I have a pretty good idea.
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
Why?
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
Tonight?
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
How do you know it was a 'she'?
That's what we're paid for.
What???
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
How nice.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Well, this explains the music.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
What do you think we should do?
Stop -- singing!!!
I think so.
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Why don't we talk inside?
MMMMmmmmm!
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Certainly, Sin
Yes.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
