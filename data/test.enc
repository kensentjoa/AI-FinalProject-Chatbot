Sure have.
She's not a...
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Have fun tonight?
Well, no...
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
They do to!
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Let go!
I just wanted --
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
Wear the belly before you go.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
I'm missing something.
You the new guy?
How many people were in your old school?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
You got him involved?
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
He always look so
What's this?
William didn't even go to high school
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
You didn't
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Pick you up Friday, then
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Are you following me?
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
Were you in jail?
I should do this.
Start a band?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
The duck?
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
No, I won't go with you
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
My grandmother's .
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Which parts?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Say it
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Have a great time, honey!
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
He's the devil's child...
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
I could be gone for years.
She said yes.
I have to explore the mainland.
Father...
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
Chief knows.
... and also to bring medicine.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Esdras is a Jew.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
All of them!  Just lies!
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I believed in you...
I have to disagree.
May I speak freely?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Do they have such thoughts?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
I will if they don't send me back.
I can't take you to my place.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
You better get packed.
Who did cause and origin?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
No!  Nothing happened.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
I'll come with you.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
My folks are.
You thirsty?
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
I don't have a girlfriend.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Yeah.
Promise?
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Okay.
Thank you.
So what's unique?
Any chance we can do that again?
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Where's your partner?
Give me the address!!
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Speak English!
Whore?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Why not?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Emil???!
It's easy to learn.
We started over, you can too.
Yeah?
I speak English.
A cheap hotel.
I'll take him.
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
How did you start the fire this time?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.

CONTINUED
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Good morning. How's it going?
Two more.
Hal?
I guess not.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
CONTINUED
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Oh, thank you very much.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Thank you.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
That's true.
Five by five, Frank.
Roger.
This is three years old.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Now how's your memory doin'?
I never paid for it in my life.
Here you go, baby.
You lying son of a bitch...
Yeah, I noticed...
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
I been waiting a long time for some money.
Where's the money?
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Where's luther?
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Notice something funny about that bus?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Bullshit red tape.
I got to wait for a call.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Hello.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
How do you know?
You're impossible...
Who the hell are you?
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
We got a lot to talk about.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Let her go.
How about some ammo?
How much?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
What're you laughing about?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
Who are you?
They all like this in your family, father?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
It's a miracle!!!
What's she doing?
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Other than that... You all right?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I'm sorry..
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
I'm not going.
It's my wife.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Apipoulai!
Love...
Finished what?
Which one?
Here we go again...
I'm so very sad.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
At least I won lunch.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
How's our deal coming along?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
Snuff?
Bullshit.
A fellow investor.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Is that him?
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
What's he talking about?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
I want his name.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Big date tonight?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Remember me?
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
I'm not a cop.
How much do you make now?
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
What about me?
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
You don't need to be here.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
Nothing remotely like this.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
Hello... ?
I remember.  You just left...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
No, sir, he is not.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
No...
How long have you been awake?
You just feel sorry for me.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
Rick, please.
Nice neighborhood.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
What is it?
I'll tell you later.
Where is he?
Hi, beautiful.
The tickets.
Dad!
I'm so sorry, honey...
You disappointed in me?
Alice!
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
You think that's the place she's buried?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
I thought about that.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Poor woman...
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
You, too?
You could train someone else.
What is it?
My father!  He's not - ?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Reef!
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
Yeah?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Dave - !
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
What's the running time?
But - what can we accomplish?
Swell!
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
Well, I'll be - !
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
No.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Chub says you're fired.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Oh.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Guaranteed, eh?
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Don't mind if I do.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
I'm fucking out of here.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
No what?
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Pop?
What do you want, then?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
What's the hurry?
Huh?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
How you holding up, Wade?
You? Why?
Want to buy?
Lillian!
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
We should talk.
Good. Who?
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
This is nuts.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
Hold on!
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Marg!
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Just do it.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
You remember Margie Fogg?
Pop, for Christ's sake!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What about Margie?
Find them everywhere. 
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
I don't know. You tell me.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
How we doing, Colonel?
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
That's affirmative.
The rest of the secret service?
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Now, or he dies, please.
What do you know of my husband?
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Stop.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
There goes your ride.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
I'll not going without my family.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
One.
Yeah, right.
Thank you for calling the white House...
You wanna knock of f?
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
What?
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Oveur.
Shut down accelerators.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted, we're taking off!
What are you doing, Ted?
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
You mean...
Now!
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Roger.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Can I hold him?
He's a boy dog.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
Striker.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
You've been hurt.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Ted, what are you doing here?
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
We have a visitor.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Airsick?
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Yes?
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Do you feel all right, sir?
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
In there.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
Let's talk Hubley.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
What is this?
Get the picture?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Who said that?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
Where'd you get this?!!
Well, let's roll, George.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
How do I look?
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
What kind of test?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
You got your vest?
Get outta there!
This floor's freezing.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
And it's too late to shut it down?
Amy.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
No.  There's no way!
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
That the atmosphere processor?
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
It's game time.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Range twenty meters.
Fifteen meters.
And how are we today?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
I don't want you for a friend.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Yes.  A little girl.
Gone.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Can we dream?
Look, I told you...
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Why won't you check out LV-426?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
No, she's fine.
And how will you make him keep it?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
What is it?
No, I'm not playing this game.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
What's the matter with you?
Yes!
There's a young girl to see you.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
What?
You're not going to do this?
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
Why not?
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
These are originals?
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Alone.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Am I interrupting something?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
I see that you're expecting.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
He's adorable!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Upstairs.
What a strange young man.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
My pleasure.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Oh, thank you.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Why so?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Yes, sir.
Why are you here?
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Pupils?
Yes.
You don't have secrets from me.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
No, really!
Are you playing a trick on me?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Is he working?
Is he working?
Opera? Opera!
Sssh!
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
No.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
How fortunate.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Yes?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Confutatis Maledictis.
The Fire.
It couldn't be simpler.
And that's all?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Exactly. A dance.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Who is on this committee?
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
About what?
So?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Well?
Is it true?
No, you didn't!
But not his body.
Oh my son, my poor son!
You mean that play?
He's setting that play to music?
Ballet? What ballet?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Well, promise then.
That lady is back, sir.
Did he say a wolf?
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Yes.
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch?
What shall we do?
No, why?
It wasn't a lunatic.
Mr. Kessler?
Aw come on, Alex!
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
I'm a werewolf.
Are you better now?
I was dreaming again?
The bedroom.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Anything.
I've left those pills for you.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
David, what are you doing?
Hello, Benjamin.
I looked.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
There's no call for that kind of language.
Who is this girl?
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Some, everyone does.
You're in a hospital in London.
I really don't know.
Jack.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
Hello.
Nice looking group.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Say, David...
Shit! David, what is that?
Jack?
Where are we going?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
I'm not listening!
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
You're not real.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Jack, are you really dead?
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
No, thank you, Doctor.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
No kidding?
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
We want to talk to you.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Me?
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Why, Matt!
Excuse me—
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Good morning.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Got my letter?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
You're lying!
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
The lobby's half filled now.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Yes.
In Cluett's office?
Did you say Dude Finlay?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
We got a problem here, brother?
How'd they --
I swear --
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
Corn gonna shoot at me?
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
The Army can hang him.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
But if we take their money and supplies...
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's planning a job.
What you sayin' boy?
Hands off your hip, Cole.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
The James-Younger Gang.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Where'd you get all these riders?
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Cannon or Gatling?
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
The safe. Now.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
What the --
Web died fighting?
What do you say, sir?
They're gone. What are you --
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Web's dead.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
That he was.
Did you kill Yankees?
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Zee.
I don't understand.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I beg your pardon?
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Did you order our houses burned down?
Mmm.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
You okay, Jesse?
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
Really!
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Your men knew the risks.
With my money!
What is that?
This is him.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
It's a plain end. I think.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Nothing like last time, promise.
Really?
He's rich.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
You're really serious, aren't you?
Because he dated her.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Listen, what about dinner?
Are you my two o'clock?
Can I help you?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Carnes? Wait.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Patrick? Is that you?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
We are totally booked.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
I'll do it.
Yes?
What is it?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Forget it.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Well...
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
Well.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Yeah...Yale thing.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Don't you know this?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
That's so typical, isn't it?
Nothing.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I've questioned him.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
I'm just screwed.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
...But?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
Here we go.
...wanna savor this.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
Will I get to work for Outpost?
Is it your software?
What?!
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
Cool!
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
You really wrote this just today?
Did you?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
I'm okay. It's going well!
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
That's great! Thanks.
Longitude 109 --
I think you should go.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
...You wanna work -- here?
Every entry was authorized.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Lisa.
You know mine.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
I snuck into #21.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I told Teddy about you.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Bring it to the other location.
...He knows.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Come in.
May I wash you?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
Thank you.
Yes?
Where am I?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
When do I begin?
Be careful.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Oh, and Austin...
She's working on another lead right now.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Yes?
Hello, Exposition.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
My wedding tackle.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
I can't see a bloody thing.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
I don't get it.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Not in the Nineties.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
What do we do now?
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...

Here, have a piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
What is it now?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
What do you want to do, Scott?
We don't label people here, Scott.
Red ...
Secret ...
Hope...
Fear ...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
Quite a collection.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
I resign.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
The result would be ...
Then what's stopping you?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
I didn't. Mother did.
Steed, we really must be --
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
And I suppose you're the knight.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
That's what we were working on.
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Do you always drive this fast?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
And do you trust me?
You're playing games.
No, after you.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
Aren't you coming?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
I'll be back ...
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
I was getting to it.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Think she really killed those agents?
Amnesia?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
Are you alright, young man?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
John Steed.
You're better than I expected.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
What do you mean?
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
I love that car.
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Nice shot.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
God, you're a slob.
Huh? Wha...
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
I can't trust you!
Are you okay?
Ilene, are you crazy?
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Give him the works.
Let's go.
It's true.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Really?
Oops!
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Feel free.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
What the hell is that?
I think you'll enjoy this table.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Reach out and snort someone.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Biggest in two battalions.
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
-- He killed people --
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
Why'd you come here, Brian?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
You okay?
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
It's okay, Stephen, I --
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
Thanks for calling.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Hey.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
I don't know anything about it.
I'm sorry.
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
I want another shot, Sir.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Read.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Nice bunch of guys.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
I have a job.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Sorry I hit Jackson.
Yeah? When was the last time?
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You don't know him.
Knock it off. Now.
Alderman Swayzak.
I'm a little busy right now --
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
You took the chalice.
Are you all right, honey?
So what are you doing here?
How are you doing, man?
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Large?
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
I want 15 on the Mets.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Everybody say Ho!
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Yeah, him.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
What's wrong with him?
I'm out.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
What kind of show is this gonna be?
That ain't funny.
Mantan?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
The name of the show?
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
This has to be a big mistake.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
What do you want?
Good woman.  I trained her right.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Let's get him over to the bed.
How long has my father been like this?
So what's up with you?
How was it?
Manray!
Hello.
You okay?
You've said that already.
Just want to say good luck.
Thanks.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
How's the food?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
He wants you to come and see him.
Finland.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
I never had a really real pair before.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
To come back to our roots.
I heard ya lady is wild.
...yes she did.
I slept too near where I fell out.
I feel a song a comin' on.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
What?
You leave something out?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
Have you taken my message to him?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Who else can give me information about you?
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
How so?
You want my heart?
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
Good night, papa.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
I beg your pardon?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
Yeah, if you've slept.
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
You did Basic here?
Some.
We're not finished yet --
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
So you killed him?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
How do you know?
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
That bad?
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
Nevertheless --
They're taking your command, aren't they?
Hostile and uncooperative.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
He's in interrogation?
Move him.
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Baseball?
What is that?
Something like that. You?
You're kidding.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
You're off to a late start.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
That was kid gloves?
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
Why do you care?
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
What?
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
Hardy, what are you doing --
What?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Pike and I got separated --
No one else heard it?
Pike never confessed.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
What happened with Nunez?
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
You want Kendall, don't you?
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Then do it.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
How long have you known my father?
How would you describe him?
How old are you?
Promise me you'll come back.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
So I've heard.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
Spooning the sherbet.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
There was one time when I was eleven...
What did she say?
Jesus Christ.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
Son?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
Tell me how it happens.
How can I convince you to stop?
So what are you up to now?
Are you Jenny Hill?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
You need to go.
I talked with your father last night.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
What happened?
How did you get here?
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
You first.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Yes.
Do you like it?
Say thank you.
You can see why it's sensitive?
Hello.
Sorry. You've lost me...
I need to know who you are first please.
Right.
She says she has a secret to tell.
When?
Put the fucking kettle down.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
Just leave her alone.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
Where's the restroom?
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
What?
You don't understand me.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
What?
Nobody's that unhappy.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Something else.
It's a long way to go for a date.
You have excellent English.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Angela?
I need to uh...
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Hey.
What do you need?
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
What happened?
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
You wanna go home?
Better?
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
YOU SHUT UP!
Don't... don't say that to me...
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Could you do somethin' for me?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
How you feelin' today?
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
What'chu sayin'?
He tapped that.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I feel better. Do you?
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I just wanted some make-up.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Why?
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
What are they doing now?
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
This should be it...
This the right place?
Getting very weird.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Where're you going, Ichiro?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Did I say that?
Nick...
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
Nick --
Nick!
I want to go talk to him.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
You did great, Ichiro.
How many men?
Ich said you left.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
They want your autograph.
Might be different in New York.
Keep the change.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
One guy do all the damage?
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
If I say no?
That wasn't our deal.
He knows what he's doing.
What's the problem?
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
We have a lot in common.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
No.
What's going on down there?
When?
Six, huh?
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
Number three.
You want to see my friends?
Prosit.
How old am I?
Let's hear it.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
You're going to be over the limit.
Why didn't you go?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
What shows?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
It's a good job.
The best.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
Why not?
Is there anything else?
Two of us might be more effective than one.
You use your equipment, don't you?
I told you I'd come back.
I don't know... I think I missed something.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
This feels stupid.
You're sick, Deckard.
Uh-huh.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
You know what I think?
Where the hell you been?
Thanks.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
Where are your folks?
Whatcha doin'?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Hi!
Oh, now, that's a great one!
Bravo!
Well, that depends...
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Please excuse this interruption.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Get out of here!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
Two weeks.
Very funny, smart ass.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Then forget it.
Yes!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
May I please be excused?
The what?
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
I thought I was here to meet women.
I like her.
Okay. I like that.
That's ridiculous.
You wanted to see me!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Is that a birthday cake?!
I've got to go, now.
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Uh-huh.
You're sure?
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
You have very nice ceilings.
That's right?
Not on him.
You bet!
What?
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
Say what?!
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
Elbows, Son.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
This is your bedroom?
Oh, my God!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Good god.
It's time.
No.  They all do.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
The locks?
Thirty -five years!
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Watch this!
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Calvin!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
In the generator room again?
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
Yes.
How long will you set it for this time?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
He go back to the hotel?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Where are you going?
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Where did he get all that information?
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
And if we can't find him?
To get some frozen poultry.
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Tower, say again!!
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
To your health, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Anything you can tell me?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
You're all through with this now?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
No.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Then don't talk about killing.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Look.
Falling.
Come in.
What do you want to do?
You like to open me, don't you?
Come on Dorothy.
I love you Don with all my heart.
You what?
I'm glad you do.
Oh no.
Bull.
Hello, daddy.
Frank?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Can I feel 'em?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
What are you lookin' at?
What time are visiting hours?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Can I use the car tonight?
No.
No, you're right.
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I've gotta go in.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Yes. I do.
You really want to do this, don't you?
What's the plan.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
What's with Mike?
Did you see her undressed?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
You didn't tell him about me?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Sandy?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
What are you saying?
You think they sold me out? No way.
What the fuck are you doing?
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
Hello.
Mother, is that you?
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Would someone please come over here and...
Oh, Jesus.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
I'm serious.
Is that right, Rambo?
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Oh, we're good man.
Who did you kill?
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Yeah?
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
So what are you thinkin' here?
And the pennies?
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Chief, what the fuck is this?
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
Promise me boys.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Hello?
Liberating isn't it?
You bet your ass he will.
I guess not.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
What color hair does he have?
OK. That's wrong.
This is he?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
She's really kind of hot.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
Loop around real fast.
What about what that guy said?
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Can I get that credit card from you?
Why not?
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
See if mine are in there.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Which one was that?
He needs to hire an attorney.
He's gone. He stole the car.
When'd he tell you?
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Why don't you come with us.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
You could give somebody a concussion.
Shit, Dignan.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
You're all clear.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
I don't know.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Freeze!
Who tripped the alarm?
Wait for Kumar.
What are you talking about?
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
How big is it?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
That was a test?
No, that door over there.
This is good.
We're renegades from despair.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Give him a second.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
Yeah.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
How much could you grow? Realistically.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
What was that all about?
Bob.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I paid for it.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
What are you doing?
What happened?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
What the fuck possessed you?
Bob. Are you coming?
That could be anybody's.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
Yes, I do.
Everything OK?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
What's wrong with Applejack?
The elevator broke.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
He said you ran away from home.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
What do you mean grammar?
Oh, yeah.
We're closed, sir.
Where?
What?
The world needs dreamers, son.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
You told me Bourne was dead.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
Why not? It was just money.
She say what time I should call?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Who else knows about this?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
You know I'm not.
Because you're afraid!
I emptied it.
Front. Use your teeth.
What do you want?
Try again.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
Pamela Landy?
But we were so careful.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
You drive.
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
See that tram coming around the corner?
Why is she trying to kill me?
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
And you got to him before we could.
Why are you here, then?
Abbott?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Who?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Oh, shit...
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Looks like he's been detained.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
It's a lot of money, Pam.
What kind of problems?
Good luck.
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Is it fresh?
Let's give him half an hour.
Anything?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
Yes. In that order.
Someone dead from this household?
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Wallace has sacked York!
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
I don't want to be a martyr.
That's just a dream, William!
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
You'll move
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Where is my son?
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
I do not confess.
I'm not just saying it!
Then when?
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
You have... you have a husband.
We can't stop!
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Anything.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
All the dads are gonna be there.
No.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Why do you ask?
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
I found these. The others are still in storage.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
What did you see? What did it look like?
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Where are you now?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
So how's Tommy?
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Not if you remember my dad.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
I was?
Then you think it might have worked out?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
It didn't feel like a dream.
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Look what you made me do!
What the hell are you doing?
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Shut up, Tommy!
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Here you go, buddy.
How did you get in here? You're under age.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
So you decided to go to America.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
And you want to know --
Go back to Bulgaria.
Good.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Goodnight.
Yes, I come.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
A franc for your thoughts.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
That's too far ahead to plan.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
But why my name, Richard?
I don't understand. What about you?
Yes.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Ask me?
Rick? Who's he?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
No. It's all arranged.
Everything in order?
I understand.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
Hello, Louis.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Victor Laszlo.
This is the end of the chase.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Sam's piano.
I have. Sit down over there.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
Make it official, if you like.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Hello?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
You ever going to bed?
No. Not me, boss.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
It's bad.
Get up.
Can't.  Need water.
Do too little you'll die.
You're putting off the inevitable.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
Jesus.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Chuck.
Four four.  A record.
I can't even keep fish alive.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
There was a coffin?
Come on.  Try.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
When's the next Jumbo?
Anything else?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Which I didn't have.
I am one lucky guy.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
You're Chuck Noland.
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
How'd it go?
I was making a point.
And never take.
For the third time.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
You're fucking dead!
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
Digital laser readers.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
And that I can drive a truck!
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
So, Mrs...
Where's Mandalay?
Oh...
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
I better go.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
I *know* this was right.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
Please don't make me say it again.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
So. What should I do now?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
What's that? What's it called?
I'm stayin', Homer.
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
First pregnancy?
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
Where's the name sheet?
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I am not a doctor.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
But you don't look very happy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Do you know him?
They told me I was too old to serve.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
Rose Rose has runned away!
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Like what?
She had you tempting fate.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
Who's that?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Jake...
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
Shit.
It can buy you a new and better you.
How much we going after?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
She up for this?
Calls?
Let me repeat -- Why not?
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Why?
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
What -- What do we do?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
What do I have to do?
You need to get a haircut.
I don't trust anyone.
He's gone.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Do you have something to prove?
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
He was looking out for you.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Sorry. I didn't know...
Tick-tock...
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
So what do you want?
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
I'll take you up on that.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
Last hand.
And your lady?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
I couldn't resist them.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
It came my way. 450 a week.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
That girl, she works at the casino --
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Really?
What?
To coincidence.
Near the casino.
I'm in trouble.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Next time it'll be my neck.
I want you to forget what I said.
How much do you owe?
I'm sorry.
Is it yes?
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
I don't think we should meet again.
Hello...
Ross.
Where to?
She's my baby.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
Who are these guys?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Where did you go to school?
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Where's the magnet?
I make it six.
You want me to check?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.

Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Do you remember the detonation time?
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Pinback...
Yes.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
You know what I think about, Talby?
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Oh yeah?
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
What's that, sir?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
That's correct, sir.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Commander? Are you still there?
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
What?
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Who's Camille?
Can I say something in my defense?
Move it.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Why would I be pissed?
What are you doing here?
What is it?
But I'm afraid of--
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I'll make it worth your while.
You're light a deuce.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--

Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
What's in it for you?
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
You believe that?
What's this?
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
None.
Who is it?
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
This is not a place you wanna go.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Thank you.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
That's odd...
No.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
And she bought that?

You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
What's that?

I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
It's gone.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
I'm not following you.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
How can you do that?
Why did you make me flood the school?
Who is... we?
Where did you come from?
I want to show you something.
Don't look so freaked.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
You're weird.
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
We're moving through time.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
What?
Come with me.
Is that a cellar door?
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Grandma Death.
So how was school today?
Know what?
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Cellar door.
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
What is her name?
Do you think a lot about girls?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Regret.
Where are we going, Donald?
How is that possible?
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
How much are they paying you to be here?
What?
He was a year ahead of us?
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Where is she?!
You're what?!
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
You-betcha.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Loretta, don't do that.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Mrs. Leeman?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Ow!
That's it, I'm goin'...
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
I hate her!
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
And the bite marks on my ears?
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
This here's Loretta.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
I'm a mirror.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
So help me, Gladys.
That's enough!
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
Oh! What is it?
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
What!
This is -- what?
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Who to?
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Half watch dog?
Oh no, I can't do it.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Why wasn't I insulted?
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
Anything else? 
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
One or two?
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
Did it go well, darling?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
John loves the house.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
This man belongs in hospital.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
How are you feeling today?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
...everyone has been very kind.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
You never mentioned his mental state.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
You alright?
Want to come out?
Of course! You want out?
Thank you very much.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
This... is my new home?
The hospital?
How long will I stay here?
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Watery headed bunch.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
A dressing bag?
Well...
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Just give me a hand.
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
Then I shall come too.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
What do you see, Erik?
Is there nothing men can do?
A lot of people like our singing.
No. 
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
He wants to kill US!
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
How deep IS the ocean?
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
Who have you been talking to?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Row!
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye, Leif.
I know. I know.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
Let me go, Sven.
For your own sake... For the others... I...
What?
My brother blacksmiths!
I can't swim! I can't swim!
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
KILL! KILL!
Well, of course he is!
There is nothing we can do...
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
How are you today?
Come over after I'm done here?
Oh, baby, what's going on?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Really?
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I can't remember.
I don't really know how --
I'm sure you would.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Where do you live?
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Yeah.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Take care.
It's pretty.
Well, I should probably get going.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
Let's talk about it later.
More?
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
You remember what happened next?
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
Yeah.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
Yeah?
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Male or female?
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
A bully? Moi?
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Doesn't sound like me.
You must have been crazy.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
It's them.
I should maybe talk to you.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
How's the chicken?
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Clementine.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
What?
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Definitely!
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
What do you want, Stan?
I know what it is.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Mary...
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Well, where was Patrick?
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Is everything getting worse?
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
A traveler, eh?
What are you doing?
Hitchhiking?
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
But Countess...
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Will it work?
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
Is that an offer?
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
Do you hear it? Right there.
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
Please...
90 over 50 and falling... .
What does?
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Patch me through to him.
I can see the hatch.
I found one.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Any survivors?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
If it worked.
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
You said this ship creates a gateway...
What are you talking about?
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
Skipper...
Smith, get out of there...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
That's an affirmative.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
Who?
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
Miller, come in...
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
Hey...
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
Claire is your wife?
How'd you know it was me?
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
Where is Reed?
Ben, come in.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
You're on fire!
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Apparently I can disappear.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
I'm driving.
They're ready for you, sir.
Leonard, how's the feed?
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Feeling better?
You're happy for me and Victor.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
'Scuse me.
How much did they cost?
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Easy, mon.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
I don't know. I was just curious.
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Leave me alone.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Hey, Mike?
Oh. Hi.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
Did you get her number?
Poor guy.
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
Who's that?
Seen the new Playboy?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
My brother is gonna shit.
That's him! He did it!
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
You'll always remember your first time.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
How long does Doug take?
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Can I come in?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
Where do you feel like going?
That's a nice shirt.
Is this your first time?
Thanks for coming to get me.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
I had a really nice time tonight.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Where's your brother?
No. That's okay.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
...I've got to go home.
Where's Mike today?
John Bonham?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Let's have lunch!
Killed?
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Rum and ice, please.
Naked!?
What happened? What did they do to her?
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Oh, my God!...
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
I have to go.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Can we make it?
I want to leave fast.
Where'd you get that knife?
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
Extract of pineal!
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
The airport is over there!
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
Could I have that, please?
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
Well, it don't look pretty.
Stop it.
I think I know where a CB is.
Oh!
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
What now, Geronimo?
I'm in.
We're going to get help.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
How are you holding up?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
How much you got to see the show?
He's dead.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Is it gassed up?
Open?
Max?
Bullshit.
'Eh, Chief?
NO, but I will lock you in.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Let's go.
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Go! Go!
Get to your cars!
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
Okay, but come here first.
What does Clifford say?
Get your clothes on, lady --
You learn your lines?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Were you a drug addict?
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
Francie, you know I can't do that.
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Are you... are you hungry?
Bread?
See you next weekend?
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Why... yes.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Just one minute...
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Harry.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Oh no...
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Where are we, mean man?
I should've known...
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
What a man!
You give up on her?
Frances, You're crazy.
Frances! Frances!
I don't know.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
And no people.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Yeah.
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
That's me, Clifford.
It's okay.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Say you promise.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
I'm back, Mama.
No!
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Huh?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
You were with him at the end.
And he drove me to mine.
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
And if I consent?
You will honor your promise to me!
What does it say?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Smell the air. Wonderful.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
I give you my soul...
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Brother and sister no more.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
Victor!
A warming wind.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Henry Clerval.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Quite a few.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
You can't. Death is God's will!
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
What happened up there?
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
What is your name?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Preposterous.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Ah. An explorer.
We should go now.
What'd you see?
Melvin Belli.
Next Friday.
How come you're leaving?
Jack?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
I'm sorry.
You said we were special.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
I love you.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
Good luck.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
What was that?
What's this guy's problem?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
What's your name?
Yes.
Where is the little lady?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
Now, is your shit together?
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
Did he...?
I promise.
It's the bitterest of pills.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
What's going on?
Creepy guy.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Yeah.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
Were you giving that pig signals?
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Richie? You okay?
How's it feel?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Richard!
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
I'm lookin' scared?
You know what you look like?
What do you mean?
You could take their head off.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
None at this time, sir.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Straight up?
Fine by me, sir!
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
Can't complain, ma'am.
You know him.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
O'Neil?
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
Chances of recovery?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
That bad?
So why are you telling me this?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
No shortage of suspects.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
I'd sure like to know who.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
O'Neil?
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
'Cool?
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
Subject?
Thought you two were file-closed.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
I take it this file is still open.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Who the hell are all these people?
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
You okay?
What are you doing?
Think we can fit up in there?
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So you made it.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
You'd be surprised.
My life sucks.
Did Romeo have a name?
Can I use some?
Mr. Caiman...
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
And how should we do that, Sir?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
What'd they say?
Hello?
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
Don't speak, Quellek.
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
About this much.
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
And note the sucked in gut.
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
A boy comes to the door.
May I get the check?
You said "the Commander.
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Hi Brandon.
Oh.  Okay.
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
Yes but, we were wondering-
Okay, we got it.
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
What?  Up?
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
Systems register functional.
... What does that mean?
It's suicide.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
Where are the miners?
Oh, they're so cute.
...Okay
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
~e're alive!
What?
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
There's nobody here. Jason...
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
never doubted you for a second.
Unbelievable.
You gotta admit, they do love him.
You should have let me hit him.
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
I heard it too.
I... certainly, but-
You... You mean Earth?
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Commander...
A model, only as big as this.
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Where?
Could be this.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
NO NO NO.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Hold course, Laredo!
Continue forward, sir?
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
Over three hundred miles.
What's your frank estimation of the British?
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
We've got powder but no ball!
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
Are you going to keep him, sir?
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
Let's not over do it...
Partially...
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
Colonel Reed...
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
You must be very rich.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Then why are you teaching me...?
You're out of your mind!
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
I guess still in the locker.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
You gave him the money?
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
Get something going there.
You know how to write one of these?
I really think I can be of service on this one.
I need the money.
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Where's Karen?
Ray Barboni?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
How'd you get in here?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Have we met? I don't recall.
That's what I'm doing.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You make movies, huh?
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
You mean, Leo?
For a movie?
She looks familiar.
Just a thought.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Here's your keys, Harry.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
It was in the Herald.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Yeah. That was a good party.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
It's not one of these?
The door from the patio, in back.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
I got you a copy of the script.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
You sure?
You okay?
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
He already knew it.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
I miss Murray, Harry.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
How did you get in the house?
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Which two?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Fucker!
Damn mind of it's own.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
What is your first name?
Roger.
You think that's funny
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
What other choices have we got?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
Mother fucker!
How long, then?
Bodies're too fresh.
Dodge to Murphy.
What the fuck -- ?
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
Yeah.
What the hell happened!
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
You okay?
Go on.
What'd you find up there?
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
Why not call for help?
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
You just shoot at something?
He needs a doctor.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
Smashed it up pretty bad.
The same day she supposedly went down.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
It's not gonna hold us.
Hey.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Nope.
What happened?
What?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
I must be in the wrong business.
Murphy, goddamit.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
What happened?
Say what?
It's a Noaa buoy.
I thought you say Tuesday.
No, no. You got leak.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Guess.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
And what can you tell us about this... 
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
...wow...
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
What the hell is wrong with you?!
So, where's "Weird Al"?
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Yeah, well --
Hi Enid.
What? Why?
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Hi, Al!
I want to do him!
What are you talking about -- who?
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
You know, the green cardigan guy.
I want to "make love" to him.
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
That was truly pathetic.
"Funky"?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Just promise you'll do it.
We still have to go in there sometime.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
What was that all about?
Give me all your money, bitch!
You're just jealous.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Hello?
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Wow... finally.
What about me? Am I not even here?
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
Every guy has a type!
Well are --
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
Relax, Seymour, relax...
So, why did you bring this along?
Yes, that would certainly do...
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
Jesus...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
I promise I'll take good care of it.
What is that?
What, like a girdle?
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Oh, hi...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
I... I don't think so.
In what way do you mean?
Uh... sure... come in.
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
What do you want?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Please Josh?
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Maybe she's with Josh?
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
You were contracted to work-
Let me see the sick.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
You've never built in Africa.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
How lucky we are.
Second death? Where?-
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
...misfire... it jammed...
Think about something else.
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
Did it look like this in your mind?
What are they looking at?
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Oh no.
No, you didn't, Frank.
Hello, Peter.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Good luck.
You're really good, you know.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Or we could do that.
Does she know anything about babies?
Maybe I should call Janine.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Sorry!
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
That's quite a story.
What is it, honey?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Can I have some of your water?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
What now, Brainiac?
You were supposed to help me with this.
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Who?
Who, Ray?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
What kind of tests?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
What happened?
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
What's your story, Pete?
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Does it have any favorites?
Now that's one ugly dude.
Are you telling me how to drive?
Are you all right?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
She's moving!
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
Is that your professional opinion?
On a purely scientific basis.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
He is the Destructor.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
What's that got to do with it?
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
In the physical sense.
All right.  What is it?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
Something was definitely here.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Who?
What now?
It's working!
Set entry grid.
I've got to sleep.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
What is it?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
Third floor.  Get down here,
How do you know?
Boy, that was a rough one.
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Yeah, Judgement Day.
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
Where is my father?
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
Where are they?
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
The Senators admire you.
Serious stuff...
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
He's very realistic.
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
Narcissus!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Then get a large cash advance.
Do you want some dinner?
I think I'd better go home now please.
I want to go home.
But could you try?
Benjamin --
Was she married or something?
Okay.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Why aren't you ready?
What is it?
What?
Don't cry. 
Why?
Don't tell me --
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
Don't you have it on?
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
You won't?
But you might.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I just don't think it would work.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Oh no. He said that.
657-2036
Ben.
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
One of those outside agitators.
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Mrs. Robinson?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Where are you?
Did you get a room?
A single room or a double room?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Sir?
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
How are you, Benjamin?
You don't?
Thank you.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
What do you think?
Aren't you?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
No.
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Won't you unzip my dress?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
But they would! Don't you see?
What?
I want to say something first.
Yes, I do.
Hello, Benjamin.
Did you get us a room?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Are you afraid of me?
You can admit that, can't you?
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Anything. Anything at all.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Oh.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Can I take off my clothes now?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
Always?
We're talking.
Well how long has this been going on.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
But you don't hate him.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
At college.
What kind of car was it?
Don't talk about Elaine.
Do you understand that?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Well, I'm not.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Now it seems to me --
Mrs. Robinson --
What have you done to her?
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
They don't know?
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
What?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Thank you very much, sir.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
You miss the point.
HUH?
Benjamin -- where are you?
I don't believe it.
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
How?
No -- no -- no -- no...
I'll pay you back.
I have an idea working in my head... 
Never?
He must be very nice.
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
You were very different yesterday.
That was lovely.
Going?
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
Oh!
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Why do you look at me like that?
Go away. Who are you --?
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
No.
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
There.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
I can't.
Thank you, sir.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
I've no luck.
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
And the child isn't coming?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
I don't know.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
Yes, of course, -- money!
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Moreover...
You're a very unusual stenographer --
What is this?
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
Oh, no.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
All right.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
I know you did -- I said you did --
Yes --
What?
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Madam will dress now, it is late.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
What is this insolence?
Yes, the police must be called.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
Four minutes past. Please come.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
I know -- I know.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
What you need is some relaxation.
What do you want with her?
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
You're calling the shots.
You ever hear about the oranges?
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Want a look?
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
All right.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Well, uh... No.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
What's that?
You ought to put a bandage on that.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
I just came back from Phoenix.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
At what?
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
I didn't teach you that.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Look at me.
Her job.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Atascadero.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
Running your broker scam, you mean.
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
That's what I say.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
What is it? What's going on?
Roy Dillon?
Sure. Let's get it over.
Yes, I know, I know.
Ate the gun. Oh.
That's that, then.
Why am I here?
Where?
I'll be damned.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
What the --
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Now you're joking, right?
Where are you going?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
What are you looking at?
Who?
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
I have to pee.
Ooooh, busted.
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
See what I'm talkin' about?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
God ... this can't be true.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
God, what's wrong with him?
Halloween.
Where's the baby?!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
What is that?
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
No!!!
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
What do you know about Michael?
Miss me, baby?
We've never met.
I suppose.
You know what gets me?
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
You know what gets me?
Can I have the Cadillac?
You know what gets me?
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
Go to the funeral?
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Hello.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
Blue soup.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
Insurance!
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
For Africa.
You invited me.
Gee whiz--
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
You were about to ask a question?
Life has denied me that thrill.
No.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Oh hell.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
What's this?
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
I'm engaged.
What do you do for a living?
Like hugging a lamp post.
Disease?
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
You used to like it stark!
Now--turn around, if you would.
Breakfast?
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
It couldn't!
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Go on.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
Why not?
I came for my clothes.
He cried.
Things.
You're begging him to kill you?
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
I mean it!
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
I thought she was a widow.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You're a son of a bitch.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
Was I ever of use?
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
No.  No.
Thank you--for my life.
What are you going to do?
Leave the rifle here.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
And you went home unannounced, too?
How horrible.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
That goes double for me.
No.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
I know.
Thank you, kind sir.
A what kind of doctor?
A lot of people don't.
I hate that thing.
Is Norbert still here?
Mom?
I don't get it.
That's why I'm crying.
Yeah.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
He isn't?
Please--
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
I see.
Is he all right?
The park!
You were wonderful.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
The what?
I wish Paul luck.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Get out of here.
You fool, you fool.
Phooey.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
No. I don't think so.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
No.
Yeah.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
You want a tip?
Now, what do you want?
That's cool.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
The other girl is the star?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
No.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
No.
Neither am I.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
It's not quite the same thing.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
She left you right?
Did you find out where she was?
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
I bought it at a store in L.A.
I don't know.
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Yeah, sure.
Where'd you hear that name?
What happened, pilgrim?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
What is it, Jake?
Jake?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
It's an investment.
Jake.
Sounds all right.
What's that?
What does that do?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
Jake'll take care of me.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Okay, lady. Out.
Check.
What do you want?
I don't know.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Yes.
But this is my car.
What do you think?
You don't look eighty.
That's a nice teapot.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
What?
What were you fighting for?
No.
With God?
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
- end where I began.
Why?
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
Would you like a cigarette?
Do you play?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
No.
Your studies?
Why?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
That's right.
Yes.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Well, I didn't.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
I... I had a visitor.
What?
Get out of the way.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
Nonsense, I...
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Well, you did break out --
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
She's dead.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
What are you trying to say?
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
Each of us gets a belt.
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
Yup.
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Are you sure about this?
You're going alone?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
Hi.
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
What about you?
But it's not true, is it?
Yes, I --
Let me alone, will you?
We want the man who did this --
Just in time.
We've got such sights to show you --
Please. Get back into bed.
What happened to you?
Back from where?
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
She'll tell them everything...
That's probably her now. Or the police.
What happened?
Kirsty? It's very late.
This afternoon.
You're done worse.
Are you all right?
I'll be down in a minute
Oh baby.
Drinking alone.
No personal details?
This isn't the bedroom.
Oh Christ.
You're awake. Good girl.
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
It's like she's waiting for something.
He's gone.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I'm afraid it's true.
I won't be able to stand.
Oh!
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
Steve. Thank God you came.
Not the point.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
We can take your car.
What?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Isn't it?
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
What the fuck is that?
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Well what about the new Echo --
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Who are you going to see?
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Yeah.
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Can I help you?
What needs sorting out?
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
So shall we leave it at that then?
Hi.
Are you coming home?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
-- Alright, alright but --
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
Yeah.  Great.
It sounds stupid.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Hello.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Are you still in love with me?
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Don't forget your CDs.
I'm sorry.
Do you want me to be there?
Look, are you coming or not?
What do you mean?
You know, with Ray...
Laura...
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
C'mon.  I want to know.
How?  How were we the same people?
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Hi.
Just local, of course.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Very persuasive.
So?
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
What's happenin'.
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Don't you like that?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Which way are you going?
I'll call you.
Yeah?
Hi, Mom.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
Hello?  Anybody there?
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
And after that?
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
This is against the rules.
Byzantine?
Who?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I have friends.
No.
You want me to front for you.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
Get out.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
Your marks would suggest great injury.
I did at that.
Aye.
How can you know this?
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Some think not.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
State of grace and all that.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Do not turn your back on me.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Where!
The last four.
Spare a chair?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
How did you find me?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
He found us even there.
I haven't drunk this much since-
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
Tradition.
I want you to come to me.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
What were _you_ looking for?
My condolences.
All I need is time.
You're a kind man to be sure.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
Morning Mr. North
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
Oh, it isn't like that.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
But --
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
How's business, Bruce?
Anything the matter?
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Well, she'll know some day.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
What's this?
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
What do you mean by that?
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
He's in the insurance business.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Then what does he want with you?
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
Now you're talking!
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
What happened?
Where is she? Tell me!
Hello -- hello...
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Ring that number, will you?
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
When did you deliver this first?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
How about Bruce's?
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Anything you want, Boss.
Let's see the money.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Boy, did you see her go?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Hold the phone!
I'll call.
What a chase!
Gus, this --
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
He's harmless.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
Just one second --
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Pure politics!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
What is it?
No -- don't out me off.
We'll fix that, too. 
And so do I!
I won't.
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
Where's the old lady?
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
There goes another scrub lady.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
You fight it cut.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Come on with that money!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
You know it is!
Kings and sixes.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Mother!
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
What's that?
What's the idea?
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
There she is!
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
That was a googly!
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Bloody.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Who with?
You're the biggest fibber.
You said that last year, Dad.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
What is it?
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
Well?
What are you going to be then?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
You know it? It must be an old one.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
And where do you think you're going?
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It seems to have survived.
What did I do to deserve this?
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Cone.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
He left!
That's not something to joke about.
Hey, great they're back.
Can I help you with something?
Wondering what?
What?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
How long have you been running this place?
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
Keep straight on this road here.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Honk at him. Scare him.
What's he so excited about?
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Should we stop?
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
Come on, get with the facts.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
And...
Is that all... think real hard.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
Goddamn.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Fuck your grandmother.
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Fuck, it's freezing.
So.
Yeah?
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
Don't even say it.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
How long has it been?
What was that?
Jesus Christ.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
A couple hours!
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
God damn.
Oh, right.
I'm gonna go ask him.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
This is way too fucked up for words.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Where is he?
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Thank you.
Get in... now!
Mr. Willis?
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
And?
Tell him, Harold.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
Hello, my little boy.
Say my name.
You decide. Today is your day.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
My little French.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Yeah? What?
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
He's dead.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
You still in the market for a real boy?
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
So?
My brother says he likes you, too.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
Yeah?
No. I married a midget.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
Oh, and the sun block?
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Who is it?
Who from work?
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Do you like my new look?
Really?
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Ugnh.
Unn.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Boys just passing through?
Pittsburgh?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Seventy-five per cent.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I never saw you do anything else.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
What happened to you anyway?
Thinking about what?
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
You name it, we shoot it.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
It's quiet.
How much we got?
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Go to hell.
Is this all we got left?
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Just like that?
What time?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Try me.
How long you been waiting?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
Can I sit down?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Yeah? What do you do now?
You don't look like a college girl.
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Why did you do that?
You got it all in your head?
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
He knows. A lot.
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
A week? A year?
No, I want to walk.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Do you remember where it is?
Why don't you start with me?
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
You and that damned garden.
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
We're going to be moving, son.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I had an awful dream.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
What's wrong, Ellen?
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
Damn.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
George, where have you been?
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
What do you want?
What?
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
Just my luck, no ice.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
You saved a lot of lives.
There's good news and bad news.
What're you talking about?
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
Pops!
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
What the hell is that?
You try Martin?
Perfect, she's using it.
You punched the President in the face?
What the hell are you doing?
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
What're you doing?
We're loose!
Is my wife in the air?
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Grey, you read me?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
He's trying to impress you.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Dick-weed.
So, what do you do for a living?
Oh. Sorry.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
How' he doing?
What the hell's going on?
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Call them back.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
What do you want us to do?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
All my life!
What has the old fool got himself into now?
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
How's the head?
What about you?
Henry! What are you doing here?!
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
I'm through!
Doctor Jones?
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
It would make me very happy.
It must be one of these...
What's that?
No. You like the way I do things.
You came back for the book? Why?
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
It's important!
It is you Junior!
I'll never forgive myself --
Found it.
If only I could have been with you.
Rats?
They want my diary.
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
I ought to tell you something.
And the chair.
My Diary's in Berlin.
What did you get?
Those people are trying to kill us!
It's a new experience for me.
This is intolerable!
Now, who are all these people?
Uh-huh.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I'm going after those horses.
I don't need camels.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Who are you?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
You understand what he tells us?
Dr. Jones.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
What does it mean, Indy?
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
You will go to palace there.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
I like the service here.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
What'd he say?
A what...?
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
He's afraid of something.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
Oh no -- oh no!!
I get it!
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Are you threatening me?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
What was that?
Behind us?
What's that?
What'd he look like?
I don't know...To get Al.
Did you hear that?
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
Corridor A.
A lab and equipment.
Like the guys that attacked us.
Black suits and helmets.
You need ID in there?
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
I'm back.
Who is it?
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Now what?
Eat it?
What is it?
You're beautiful..
.
Wait.
Touch her.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
You really like that shirt?
Much too blue.
Which one is she?
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Follow that busboy.
Joe, be careful!
What Happened?
Some agent you are.
Come on, she's getting away.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
What?
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
It's him.
You sure this will work?
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Aim just in front of his face.
Do something.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE What abilities...?
What is your name?
I didn't do anything.
Nice?
They have stolen state property.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
Sir?
That crazy guy?
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Not...complaining, actually.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Don't do it!
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
What?
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
What's so funny?
You again.
I waited for you.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Joe! What happened to you?
He didn't.
You're leaving.
I'm leaving too.
A chip. Goes in a computer.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Now what?
That must be him. Water taxi.
Why'd you ask him.
So do I.
Why not?
What a mess.
Kiss her you fool.
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
He wants to apologise.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
Yes.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
What's new?
Yeah? What for?
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
What does that do?
When's the air date?
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
You're exaggerating!
A gun? Yes.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
Come again?
Hi, baby.
Hello?
What's going on?
...taping?  What are you taping?
Use the bathroom.
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
No classes this morning?
What's wrong?
What?!
Yeah...
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Area code 212-555-0199.
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Thank you for saying that...
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Yeah, that's right.
Give me a break!
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
I know what I have to know.
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
Seven dwarfs?
Hello. You there
Why?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Excuse me. Yeah...
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
I told the truth!
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
Just give me an example...
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
Most certainly.
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object to the form!
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Is that a threat?
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
So she's uh, flourishing?
You're in a rush.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
You're in check.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
He's the wrong man.
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Who was that?
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
So who'd you hire?
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
You're vulnerable.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
How nice.
I assume this is on Rex?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
What is it you're after, Miles?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
He's passionate.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Marylin? When did I say...?
Screw you, asswipe!
Oh. And that is -- mom?
She never particularly cared for me.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
We're damaged goods.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
But?
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Good.  Are those foods?
Hi.
I have a surprise for you.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I want to nail you ass.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
You were going to have this thug...?
Hello Marylin.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Who's that?
Is this a lover?
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Do you know him?
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
You're not...
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Is this Ming?
My client has ruled that out.
And it's good!
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
In anticipation of making you sick.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
Three is not Farrow.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
We'll go into that some other time.
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
You ought to know why. Because—
Because marrying that fool King Westley is—
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
You only met him once .
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
Ellie—
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
Ridiculous!
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Are you going to see him?
Why should she? After all—
Been sending her meals in regularly?
What about that diamond wrist watch she had on—she can raise some money on that?
What would you like to have me do?
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
What do you think you're doing!
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
What am I going to do now?
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
My ticket?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
I never thought of that.
Here, boy!
Now, just a minute—you can't—
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
I wish you'd stop being playful.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What're you going to do?
Eat a carrot.
What happened?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
—six—seven—eight—nine—
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
In about fifteen minutes.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
Hey—you not up yet? Come on—come on!
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
Who's she gonna marry?
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
Listen, man—I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
What do you reckon that's for?
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
Yeah.
Huh?
Wife?
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
I can use a smart guy like you.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
And Oswald?
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Who?
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Why?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
You still questioning any Cubans?
...give me protection?
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Why?  What's wrong?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
Aren't you being a little hard?
No.  Never heard of him.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Are they?  Why would they?
Jim Garrison?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Well, thanks for coming.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
You have other information?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Where is Banister in all this?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Sure sounds like he's winning.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
How many men are working with you on this?
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
But then you told her you were home.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
You were there for me.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
What'd ya mean?
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
And you didn't tell the Police?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
I'm not a loser.
Help yourself.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Help us do what?
I'd love one, but not there.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
He's the one who wants you.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
What'dya think?
He came by.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
How do you get it out?
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
Really?
How'd you feel about it?
It's different with men.
My ass ain't the same.
Does something else worry you?
You talk them into it?
I called you last night.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
You're avoiding the question.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
In a dress.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
Who's side are you on?
He say we like the same thing as married.
Yes'm.
Oh, Miss Brown?
Look, that shit ain't mine.
We'll just be a minute.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
I'm sure that was the idea.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
You didn't count it?
Ever been tempted?
Uh-huh.
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
Killian's.
Uh-uh.
He said he didn't know about it.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
You think I'm kidding?
Jackie?
For what?
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
How the fuck they know that?
You told em? You told em it's me?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
I don't know. One of your friends.
Can you cover that?
Who?
What does she think she's gettin?
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Who's paging you?
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
It's boring, isn't it?
Want a hit?
You're fourteen years old here?
With Ordell?
Did you ever go I one?
Is it dead?
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
We're leaving now!
Lemme have the bag.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
Whatcha watchin'?
Uh-huh.
Who was that?
I didn't look like a bum.
What's your relationship?
She believed you?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
You shot Melanie?
Couldn't talk to her?
Came outta where?
Then what?
Where you shot her.
That's Winston. He works here.
Who's it for? A relative?
Getting there.
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
House or apartment?
Comfortable?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
You still there?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
That's all?
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
It's the next street.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
I'm alive.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
What do you want?
Grass never did that to me.
You know, you got a strange line here.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Hey, wait!
Daddy, what was that noise?
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
He say what they looked like?
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
No.  I see them.
What was that?
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
She was good in bed, though.
Jacob, what can I do?
They stole it.
That help?
The room!
What happened to you?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Thanks.  What's that?
Who? Jed?
What's in here?
Is that the one who died?
Wait. Don't.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
Why? What for?
What the hell are you doin'?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Who was that?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Bullshit!
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Where are they?
What's going on?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Why won't you answer me?
I don't know you.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
This isn't happening.
WHO ARE YOU?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I can't move.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
He'll never make it.
I'll page him.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Speaking.
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
Still married, Jake?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
I don't know. I don't know.
Can I help you?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
What are you doing?!!
What's that?
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Uh-oh.
We're not supposed to do that.
We'd need charges.
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Sergeant!
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
Outta here?
Hey.
I couldn't save them.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Well?
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Okay?!!
You must shut down the engines.
I'm missing two!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
What are you doing?
No.
Robot huh?
Barbie from hell...
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Kay-Em we made it!
Kay-em you okay?
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
I don't understand...what does he want?
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Azrael can you repeat that?
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
Son! -- Out of the water now!
Did you bring a check?
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
This is Matt Hooper...
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Did you get him in the head?
Probably out in the back yard.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Be careful.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
You too, sweetheart...
Home... New York?
Only 24 hours!
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
What's that?
How can you tell?
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
Where'd you get all this?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
This has got to be one big violation...
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Christine what?
Think she might've run out on you?
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
You love sharks?
What have you got there, Lenny?
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
I'll drink to your leg.
Coming right to us!
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
Hey Bleek.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
What's up?
Is that normal?
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're being really immature.
I still have your virginity!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Wait, let me take that.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
We definitely want it to have junk.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Cold feet.
Hello?
Cute?
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
What?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
You should try Adderall.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Is the baby okay?
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
No...
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
Who is the kid?
Hi Dad.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
I sort of already have.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
The Penny Saver sucks.
You're not listening to me.
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
What do you make with that?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
What would be a good time for you?
You lose!
Hi, I'm Adele.
I'm cool.
What's this?
That's me.
Carryin' a gun.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
Early, what're you doin'?
What the hell is this stuff?
What's wrong with her?
This guy killed a mess of people.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
Nervous?
...Need a hand with those bags?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
...never?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Early, just think...
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
...Diebold?
How old you?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
You're clean.
Well, how was it?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
Shit.
78th.
Why?
You got any money?
Well, those guys share everything, right?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
I hate this game.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
Yeah. Why you give money.
So really, it's good luck.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Man we fucked him up.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I'm nervous.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
How old are you?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Yeah.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Are you in trouble with the law?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Hello.
You still mad at him?
I'm coming.
Who, Benny's little sister?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Yep.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Oh shit.
Yep.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
Yeah?
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
So, how many people live here now?
What's that supposed to mean?
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
Morpheus.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
He's not talking about himself.
You're a lying bastard!
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
What do you think?
You think he's dirty?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
Sorry.
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
What do you mean, stand out?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Why her?
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
Just for that no hint today.
What?
I know where you are.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
What is it?
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Congratulations, dad.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Who told you that?
How long has she been dead?
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
You mean, no prints but hers?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
Kathy?
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
He's right, Kathy.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
Answer the question.
What do you see here?
Bainbridge Books.
Bainbridge Books.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
What are you looking for?
They couldn't break the riddle.
Do you?
You have to win every point, don't you?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
I just don't want to fight with you.
I'm hungry.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
Peter...
Exactly.  It's the key.
Hi.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
You beat him.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
I'm not nervous.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Lyssa ...
Lyssa ...
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
You have not slept in two days.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
<u>Why</u>?
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
She must make a glaive.
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
Do not let the waters touch you.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not worth returning to?
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
My <u>friend</u>.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
And where do you lead, boy?
You've eaten nothing.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
You!
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
Each to his fate, lad.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
I was beautiful then.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
...Office 2702.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
Good! First shot!
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Come on, get down!
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
Where are you going?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
You say it just to calm me!
Don't fear.
How are you, Miss?
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...Composer.
...OK... Good.
But... He works for your same employer?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
Do you recognize him?
He probably just went somewhere.
It's impossible.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
The new store?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
I don't know.
To where?
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
Shit!  He jumped!
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
What happened?
Where?
When are you leaving?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
There are a lot of people worried about you.
Good morning.
Is it a boy or a girl?
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Water?
Sarah -- with an H?
I guess I do too.
Don't run away.
This is the home of an angel.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
What do you mean?
Me neither.
Don't you like me, Ben?
I am planning to go out and do some work.
What do you mean?
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
I don't understand any of that.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
I wanted to see you...
About ready for another drink?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
You have been lonely?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Where have you been?
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
What alibi?
Is he always such an ass?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
I do. I'm not allowing it.
What's going on?
Why didn't you call me?
I'm sorry?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
You can't even imagine.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
God, that felt great!
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
You almost had me fooled.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Too demure?
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Don't ask.
But maybe it's not what you think.
What the hell is that for?
I don't --  Do that stuff.
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
So now you're -- ?
Oh, my God!
Someone missed you.
No -- it's just -- not me.
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Neither.
I did?
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
That's not entirely --
C'mon. Let me take you home.
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
Pink ones.
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Why so few?
Fire moat... why do that?
We watch... good fun...
You go to lady now?
Your love.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
Like some vile toadstool.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
What was that?  Did you hear that?
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
And if I cannot?
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
Pregnant, is she?
Aye!  That too.
Fine-looking army.
We must follow that bird.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Worse than the battlefield.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Nice piece of work.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Why not mine the damned walls?
There isn't much time!
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Can't we move any faster?
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
These for me?
Liar!
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Oh, dear.
Tis the truth.
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
How do I get the horn back?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
Please...
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Uhm... fine work.
You're with us in battle.
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Simple as that, eh?
Can you show us the way?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
Are you going to see Sam again?
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
And video games after!
Oh.
Why?  What do you mean?
Sorry I got you into trouble.
Don't you have school?
What's today?
It's not what I was expecting.
He's a freak.
I can't even take a shower here.
I might not stay, anyway.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
I wanted him to marry her.
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Josh said...
I was wondering.
Not really.
I thought I was helping you.
You hate your father.
Where are you?!
Why is that?
He won't leave my room.
This is such a street of whiners.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
I hate to ask about a window.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
I'm good, thanks.
Pardon me?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
I did warn you.
I forgot where I put my keys.
I'll be around to check up on you.
I'm not going!
What are you doing?!
It bugs me.
No one would blame me if I left!
I'm not doing it!
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I can promise you complete privacy.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
I know the feeling.
What are you now?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
After everything.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I still don't know what that means.
Can you build a house in four months?
Ah!  Oh....
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
Because Dad left?
When's school over?
I drove over and you were gone.
I did say he could go.
I used to live here.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
Is your back still killing you?
Nothing.
I wasn't sure.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
We've eaten.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
After the kids are back in school.
You never really trusted me.
That's the problem.
Where are the kids?
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
I brought a few of my own.
A night in the hole?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
No, but...
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Want me to come back some other time?
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
I got it... boss.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Don't I know you?
Sure I do. What's your name again?
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
My daddy gave me this watch.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
What ain't there?
This fork is filthy.
No, man. I want you to have it.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
What does that mean?
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Don't mention it.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
I know people.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
Crop duster.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
What?!
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
I can't eat this.
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
What is that?
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
Where am I at, man?
1932? That's like, that's like...
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
Is everyone here?
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
Where'd you get this?
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
Is this a joke?
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
That's what I thought!
Hello, Cassius.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
I'll call her later.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Now everybody sit down.
You're a good devil, Dad.
This is bad, Nicky.
No. This can't be happening.
You came through, Nicky.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
Thanks.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Looking for the chief.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
The South.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
No.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Yes...
..."The Devil?"...
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Off limits.
That just hurt a lot.
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
Where do you think we came from?
That's better.  How do you want us?
How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
How did they get in here?
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Do you have anything special in mind?
Why?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
Who invited you?
What the hell took you so long?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
What's your name?
When do you go up?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
Well then...?
Sad? What made you sad?
And now?
I'm listening.
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
About running, dying what?
And then you killed him, right?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
I -- I can't.
Are you taking me to them?
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
I'm afraid.
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
I hate outside! I hate it!
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
And Sanctuary?
What kind of jewel is this?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
We'll have to bury him.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
Where are they?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Are you ready to put him in?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
Well? How do you like it?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
What's happenin'?
You okay, man?
I'm, okay... You okay?
Why not?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Can I call you?
Pete?
What deal?
How'd it happen, Alice?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
You all right?
Dick Laurent?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
I don't. I don't know him.
Yeah.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Never saw him before in my life.
His condition? What do you mean?
You just gonna let him go?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
There's no other bedroom?
Something wrong?
What is it?
Who's it from?
Does it say anything on the tape?
When you didn't come to the club.
From the club. You didn't answer.
What's that? Another tape?
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
Where would you feel safe?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
I thought you were getting me a drink?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
At sixty?
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
Hello.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
Sheila?!
I didn't know you cared.
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Hey... Sheila.
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Well, that's that, I guess.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Where is your mad pilot?
Goodness, no!
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
—buy and sell?
He amputated his own leg?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Charming, isn't she?
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Are you taking me?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
Oh, stop it!
Oh George, come on.
I don't know.
Well - I mean—
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
What about the porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Maria?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
You say the porters are waiting for us?
The clothes?
was saying—
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
Good.
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
What is?
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Ouch!
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
You shot an eight year old girl.
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
You think we're nuts.
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
We'll take it from here.
It's a bug.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Ha ha.  No, really.
What?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
The radio show?
Jesus Christ...
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Since how long?
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
You were saying?
After I got the shit beat out of me!
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
What do we do?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
Nowhere.
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
We need to talk to you about the alien.
I'm getting a trajectory...
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
No.  Follow him.
The other two will die without me.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
That's not much.
From where?  D.C.?
I put you away --
Kill type?
Victim's a white female.
Hence the expression...
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
Can you fake the cerebral output?
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Somewhere near the capital?
Go ahead.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
She was looking right at me.
Just go to the beginning!
She's a precog?
Are you reading my mind right now?
I won!
What the hell.
Who are you?
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Who made you do this?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
Why?
Why should I trust you?
-- and then walk out.
Which one is that?
Who?
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
Congratulations, sir.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
He looks familiar.
We could have lunch together.
This your work?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
It was nobody's fault.
You know I need to use you.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
All the suites are about the same.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
What the fuck was that about?
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
What's wrong, baby?
Hello.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
I want you to quit.
I'll support you.
Your dance is over.
Yeah.
What's his name?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
What's that?
Where is this happening?
Brooklyn.
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
You bet the ponies?
A million. Easy.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Yes.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Spa?
I'm on the phone.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Can you check?
So, it's not a winning record.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I'll page you with the number.
He implied it.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Nice work.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Oh really. Why's that?
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
This is bullshit, man.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
What the fuck is that supposed --
You happy?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
What are you doing.
All the more reason.
Eighty five.
Three and a half hours?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
No. I'll wait here.
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Where's the surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
I want to leave right now.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Yes.
You strapped?
It means you got a gun?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Stop.
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
Here they are, then.
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Come, now. You just got here.
So whenever we want...
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
I call 'em wiggers.
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
What about my keys?
I get it.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
So, we're talking money laundering...
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
I told you less paper, less trouble.
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
I'm wearing, Archie.
Let Billie finish.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
What the hell for, man?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
The body is a holy repository.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
Why are you looking at me like that?
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
Let him finish.
And like a fool I believe it.
You know that gal?
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Let me die then.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
You want to be the head man?
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
They talked about me like
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[Daniel.]
[Who pays you?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Please, don't...]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
Were you provided with a gun?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
No.
Potential? I don't understand.
What are you doing?
Well, I let him go.
It hurts.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
You feel sorry for the husband?
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
Be a swimmer.
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Creasy.
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
He's not a cop killer.
You helped him get this job.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
Who told you that?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
Who?
What they say?
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
Marty.
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
You come up here often?
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
Marty...
No...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
Are you kidding?
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
So I'll die without a son.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
I said, is she Italian girl?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Tommy...
Tommy...
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Yes, O'Reilly?
Epidural hematoma?
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
Y'all mind the store.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
Wisconsin.
So long, Ho-Jon.
You got directions?
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
What's that?
Y'all just act natural.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
We think the same way.
Wait a second...
Give us this day our daily...
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Black capsule.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
For you, Trapper.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
See you.
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
How much time do I have?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
I have not understood what you means.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
The blonde dish.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
About that chest-cutter...
What's going on? Who started this?
O'Reilly!
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Sir?
Good morning, Colonel.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Hello, John.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
How much money do you get?
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
Hello?
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
What?
The letter from John Doe.
Duets? But can we trust him?
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
What do you do when you work?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Who's got him?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
You don't have to—Why, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
Listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Well, I don't get it.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
What are you doing up here then?
How about family? Got any family?
Is there anything wrong?
Flowers.
She isn't?
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
What do you mean, too bad?
Racket? What do you mean?
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Spencer of the Chronicle .
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
What's the line?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Really?
Hi, Roper.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
For now that's all.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
You have to. It's a tradition.
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
To run last?
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
I wanted to get this out of the way.
It's already started.
What do you think?
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
You like this place?
Yeah?
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
...the hell are you talking about?
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Roper.
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
What have you promised them?
There are two million people in there with you.
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
You were right.
Who are you?!
But this is impossible.
You sure he's going to come?
What's her name?
The woman you're stuck on.
He had keys.
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
One condition.
A hotel?
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
An interface attendant.
I've got to get back.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
Why?
What?
It was just there.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
Access granted.  Male or female?
Standard, modern, upscale --
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
... Nothing.
I'm in!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
It's... an eagle?
... A falcon?
Hey, boss!
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
I'm outta here.
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
But boss, what about their parents?
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
What is THAT!
I am the mighty ape!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
You own a hotel, sir?
So Chicago's been good to ya.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
Boo-Boo.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
And now you have everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
What do you mean?
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
I got my partner in there!
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Well...
You got something to hide?
Would it be painful for you?
I been thinkin'...
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
I'm glad ya come.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
What are ya thinkin'?
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
We learn from life.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Forget it.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Yes?
Best we got.
Take any one ya like.
Who did this?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Back? You're sending me back?
Death! Thank you!
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
Uh huh. And?
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Bitchin' good cake.
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Stu?
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
Hypnos?
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Don't ask where I got it.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Stu...Stu...
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
So, what do you think?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
How are you doing sweetheart?
But I was dusting.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
Really?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
Huh?
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Okay. You don't mind?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Where?
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
You know, we're getting married.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
All right, why?
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
*But you never asked me*!
Jeff for Senator.
A dirty frame!
Yes. Come in.
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
Yes, I was--
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Just fine.
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
What is it?
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Good. Where are we?
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
On paper?
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Yes, yes--
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Letitia.
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Where do we go from here?
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Sure.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
No?
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Father--oh.
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
That's going to be fun.
Since he was born.
Pixilated.
Oh, yes.
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Feel better now?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Have you seen the papers?
You said I was a lady in distress.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Mary, I'm going home.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Uh-huh.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
The guy's balmy.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Huh?
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!
Did it?
Sure.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Gold, eh?
Is that the best you've got?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
How is this, sir?
He's not home, I tell you!
Nuisance value?
Miss Bennett please!
Must we have the echo?
Newspaperman?
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
No?
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Why not?
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
Well, I don't know. I—
Proceed.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
Who are they?
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
Farmer?
No, sir.
You came home last night - without them.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
But she's on the telephone—
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
Thank you.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
What's that?
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
What?
You find it distasteful, don't you?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
What do you want to know?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
What it might take is... doing time.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
How are you?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
What can you tell me about this?
When did you start to feel this way?
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Mom's such a cutie.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Sore throat?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Hello?
You feel violated?
...but first, you have to tell me something...
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What are you talking about?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
What?
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
A doll?
How's it coming?
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Who else knows?
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Sounds like you have several.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
But look at me now...
At least you pulled yourself out...
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Sorry...
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
It's possible. I don't know about that.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
Altar boys?
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
C'mon, friend.
Yeah?
The key!? She has the lost key!?
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Where are they taking him?
No women allowed.
Fifty percent.
No?
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
Yeah, I was there.
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
That "thing" gets me excited.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
You two!
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
No... Why?... Should I?
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
Got it!
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
I'm your sister.
Do you really think he'll show up?
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
What do you suppose killed him?
I found it, Evy! I found it
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
What?
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
And what's that?
It must have slipped my mind.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
We didn't think this through very well.
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Are you an actress?
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Come here.
Stay away!
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Or talk?
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
I'm going inside.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Bye. 
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
What are you talking about?
There's just not enough of us.
But she still might call!
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
So where's the art?
What's that?
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Yes, Obie-wan.
Jeffrey!
And there's the Sphinx.
To us!
Where am I going?
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Ah -- you approve?
I'm glad you like it.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
What do you mean?
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
About 5,000 troops.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I don't know, sire.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
Read it back.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Bastia -- and you?
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
What's your name?
I know of no better time.
When is she supposed to return?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Were you in love with any of them?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
Were any of them married?
She must have been in love with you.
Promise me you will never leave me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Separate bedrooms?
But you will not... be safe...
Who is it?
I believe you sent for me.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
What the hell is the matter with you?
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
Do you know what you're saying?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
You mean you heard them making love?
And, where did you see my portrait?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Great moves, Day-Day.
What you mean talk to her?
What's the green stuff poking out?
Me neither.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Damn, you got a stalker.
Why?
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
How you know?  It could be anything.
I will.  When can I come visit?
Huh?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
I did.  Is that door locked?
Next time, page me first.
You alright?
I don't play for no team.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
What's the matter?
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
What kind of activity?
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
I do.
Roach, what are you doing?
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Tape his mouth shut.
Rancho Cucamonga?
Just do it.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Need to lose some weight.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
Amtrack?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
Somebody close?
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
You were very nervous.
How do you know that?
What?
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
For what?
Can we go now?
I will do no such thing.
What about the gun?
He's dead?
You killed him.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
I kill her - and you kill me.
One thirty. California Ballroom.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
Are you sure?
I think you better put that away.
No. Kisses to you.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
I have to do something.
You got anything smaller?
Please. Something is going to happen...
Who?
Oh, Jesus ...
You're going to go see her.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
You stole that.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
That's pretty good.
I'm not a baby.
Close your eyes.
I've got something for you.
You got this under control?
It's under control.
I'm looking for them.
Foreigners! Fuck!
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
Put her on.
Any trouble?
What do you figure he done with it?
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
No, Ben.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
I'll light the lamp.
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Plan on a longer visit next time.
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Twenty-five wives!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
To see Dad?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Tell me what, boy?
What are you doing, boy?
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
How old are you?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
O no! Your turn!
Can I have milk too?
The first night?
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
Get up, Willa.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What's wrong, John?
I been bad!
You'll whip me!
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
Worked like a charm.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
What the hell's going on!?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Yeah. So?
Hello?
Much better.
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
Bring him out of what?
How you plan to do that?
What!?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
She dreamed this would happen...
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
What's the Coroner got to say?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Who? Who did that?
Where you think you're going?
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Do you think I did it?
Thank you, Comrade.
Aren't you late?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
What is it, Anna?
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
That's her.
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
We had to take it on account of the safe.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
The former Duchess!
What time have you, Gaston?
I am, Gaston.
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
We can call our ambassador.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
What proposition?
Comrade Buljanoff...
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
Allow me, Comrade.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
...and Kopalski.
Business.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Thank you.
Why do you need my finger?
Suppress it.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
Yes, it is.
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
Then you don't want me to go there.
I will start with you.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Then do it through my lawyer!
I didn't follow you.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Just smile.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Are we going to build our little house?
Not white, darling.
It's dead.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Did you win?
Those newspaper people?
Oh, Leon!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
You haven't seen her yet?
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
That bad?  Old or young?
Thank you.
Yes, Swana.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
All right, I'll listen.
Hello, Leon darling!
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
At Père Mathieu's.
It's just a place for workmen.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
He told me to take you to his conference room.
How's the job coming, Bob?
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
I understand that, sir.
To protect his people.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
McCord? ...
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
The country's loving it.
No, you didn't, Bob.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
About a dozen.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Sir?
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
More light, chief?
What'd he say?
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
I never met the man.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Where'd you find him?
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
The lie?
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
We lost ...
It makes us human ...
Amen to that.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
Yeah ... I'm out.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Congratulations, Dick.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
Tomorrow.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
It'll be over soon.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Some say you are, Rocky.
You heard it?
How you been, Ellis?
I am older.
That man that shot you died in prison.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Carla Jean...
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
We goin' in?
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
How's that, Sheriff?
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
Don't get hurt.
What do you think.
It ain't even three years we been married.
I got it Mama.
I put it in, Mama.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
Not like that. Not like you say.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
What'd you give for that thing?
I need to know that.
Goin' where?
You can't afford one?
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
I know where the money is.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
Is somethin' wrong?
Will there be anything else?
Now. We close now.
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
Well... I need to close now --
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Tent poles.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
You on all night?
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
It's all right.
November the 28th, last year.
Yessir.
Well enough.
What do you want to know?
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
You tell me the option.
What about one forty-two.
Waitin' for my wife.
...What do you do?
What did you do?
So was I.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
How is she?
Could I have that in American?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Sheriff, I don't...
You should get the order you want.
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
It wasn't a woman.
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Oww, the arm, the arm!
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Lyla's very nice.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
I don't think your friend likes me.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
...like the water purifiers?
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Uh-huh.
What're you doing here, Roy?
What's the matter here?
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
You don't sound like you're from here.
It's something I had to do. For David.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Guess who I saw today.
Looking for someone?
Your husband?!
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
The fuck you talking about?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Really. And where was that, old man?
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
That is so right.
Now, that's really stupid.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Can I have an evil twin?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Did Chloe crack?
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
Her show?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Suckin' away.
Devil his due.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
That's not my ring.
I counted to three, honey.
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
A million dollars.
An' all my meals for free...
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
Pete... I do apologize.
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
It was a powerful air.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Hi, Byron.
Who's that?
Great ass.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
When did this happen?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
I know.
See you in the fleet, sir!
What did you call me, boy?
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
Where are you from, boy?
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Louder!
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
That was you guys, huh?
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
He ask you out for next weekend?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Do you go to school?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
There's always a choice.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
I'm looking for Sid.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
What?
What the fuck is funny about this?
Yes.
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
One.  Squeeze.
Get the fuck away from me.
Bullshit.
The walls are steel, right?
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
They won't get hurt.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Be quiet.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
'Bout four o'clock.
Can we come in?
You don't look so good.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
No cars.  Feet are faster.
Shoulda got an apartment.
What's going on?!
Can't hear a thing.
What if they get in here?
I heard you.
"What we want is in that room."
Fuck.
Are you freaking out?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Why?
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Well... is it loaded?
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
...Glad you came man.
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
You want me to put a man on it?
Now hold on Rodgers...
Yes sir, I did.
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
C'mon let's...
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Fuck is up?!
We'll all get out of here together.
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
My Mom's at that.
Ain't no one seen him.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
You believe that?
Congratulations.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
What unit?
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Thank you.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
Do you see that, Colonel?
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
Is it?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
A long time ago...
You were an Englishman then...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
We saw.
Where is he now?
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Not held, just slowed down.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
How far away?
Don't worry.
Reverend.
Thank you.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
Father, you can't let them take him...
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Honey, Church will be fine.
No-I guess not.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
I'm not climbing that.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
And Buckaroo Banzai.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
My God!
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
I heard you tonight.
I'm going to try to do better.
What's in your head, boy?
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
No, I really think I do.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
There's ... another exit?
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
You have a name, missy?
You've got sand, for a maid.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
The curse drove you to gather this?
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
You're speaking up for him again?
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
It doesn't!
Miss Swann.
You are despicable.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
Who makes all these?
You cheated.
Because you're a pirate.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
Are you certain this is the right way?
No, it's not.
You haven't seen it.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
He may be.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
I know what you're doing.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
She says it's not.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Did you feel that?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
Where did he go?
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
What did security say?
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
What are you going to do?
I don't believe this is happening...
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
You're afraid of him.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
Yes?
The big house.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
They did it to me!
Why do we need it?
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Susan!
Look at this!
Just look at it!
Just like old times.
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Do you have something to bring me down?
What's wrong?
I could go with you.
Did you go?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
Argon's private lab.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
I could have you fired right now.
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
I think I better go, Stew.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
I suppose you're going to print them?
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
You have the cutest nose I've—
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
No? What do you look upon her as?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Anne, come here. Listen—
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
What's the idea, Anne?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
This way.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Yeah, little Gloria.
Right - for the first time this year.
Come on, get going, get going!
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
It has been alleged - yes—
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
And live on your salary, I suppose?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey—  Let me know when you're quitting.
You're my what?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
The boss is getting hoarse.
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
Thanks, thanks.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Thanks. May I sit down?
I don't eat waffles.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Yes - the worm!
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
But I—
Did you call, sir?
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Yes.
Can I ask you a question?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Oh no ... I'm fine.
Have you got any make up?
Does it look okay?
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Bud?
It's alright. Let me see.
How was your day?
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
But it could happen.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Are you alright?  What is it?
What happened?
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
How'd you know about the fire?
Mr. Simpson ...
What are you doing?
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Can we do any better?
Jen, listen ...
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
You have no right to do this.
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
You're reading?
So what is it?
Yeah ...
How come I'm still in black and white?
Are you sure?
Hi.
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
What's going on?
Where are they?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
... Like Prince Charming.
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
What?
BUD.
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
Look ...
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
Bud?
What's wrong?
Oh hi!
Bud ...
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
You know what I really like?
It's an art book.
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
It's beautiful.
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Free?
Hey.
This is Barry.
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
Yes, I'll be there.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
What city?
What's the listing?
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Hello.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
You look nervous.
Why?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Hey. What are you doing?
You're so scared.
No she didn't; that's a lie.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Tell me why.
Yes.
Where are you?
...just talking to you....
Really?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
-- you said you did.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
Hello?
There's a piano in the street.
Hi.
Business is good, you're busy?
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
You like her?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
What happened?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Oh that's great.
Hello?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Yeah.
That's right you travel so much.
Yes I'm sorry.
Did you have my home phone number?
Ok.
Yeah.
On my knife.
I didn't do that.
Your hand is bleeding.
The police are on their way.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
You want her to call you Jack?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
I'll say whatever I want --
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Yeah.
Mhm.
Hey, good morning, Barry.
You ok?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Where you been?
Yes I am.
Nothing.
Seven o'clock.
I know.
Ok.
As soon as you want.
Your expenses are your own.
Hello?
It's ok. That's alright.
Yeah.
It's not bad, it's ok.
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
Marquis? Is that you?
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
He can't do that to me.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
Don't confuse one organ with another --
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
His wife's?
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
It was fiction, of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
I'll do everything in my power --
He'll do no such thing.
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
As you say, Doctor.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
...yes, I've got that bit...
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
How was I to know, my darling?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
Doesn't that please you?
Ever met Walter Winchell?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
The actor
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
How bad is it?
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
He lied to me
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
Hearst?
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
What are movies about, Orson?
Magic
Not for me.
But with compassion and insight--
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Yes.
Let me out.
How?
What?
Well, at least she's off KANE today
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
You gonna watch?
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
It came.
To do what?
You're going to destroy it
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
Well it' s all you've got !
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
What who's been sayin'?
Believe what you want.
This looks done.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
You're a good sport, lady.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
What's wrong?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Sure. What is it?
Harder.  Take the towel off.
How do you know? You know her that good?
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Do you see her yet?
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
See? That's all there was to it.
How's that?
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
What?
What do you mean, "you"?
But you said "you."
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Jake...
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
That he's got a pretty face.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
I went out.
I called. You weren't there.
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Open the door, Vickie.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Hey, leave the kids alone.
I said, let's go.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
And you're drinking with them right now.
This is the baby sitter.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
His wife took a trip.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
She never left the apartment --
-- until yesterday morning.
Who said they left then?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
If possible -- both.
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
I knew it!
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
You're never going to marry?
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
A Federal offense.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
Thank heaven that's over!
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
What do you need money for?
Yes.
Who's Thorwald?
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
What a day I've had!
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
So do I.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
What do you think?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
Lisa, please!
What are you getting at?
Yeah.
No comment.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
What doesn't?
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Huh?
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Friend of yours?
Nobody chickened.
You know something?
Where can we meet?
Buzz Gundersen.
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
How'd he get in?
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
You thought I was Mom?
What would you do, Dad?
Blood.
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
You remember me?
Boy!
He has a knife.
What?
Who has?
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Come out come out wherever you are!
We'll take it!
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Wash up and go home.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
He called me chicken.
They never do.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What a zoo!
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
If he could--
Okay--
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Plato!
Yeah--why--
The kids take me.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
Goodbye!  See you!
They'll be looking for you.
No--I was just--maybe--
You still pretty upset?
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
I'm getting that way, too.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Why did you do that?
Where you going?
You can't talk underwater!
How many rooms do you think there are?
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
No!
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Good evening.
A man of some travels.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
He wants... your "sister"...
-- till he fucked his parole --
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
You can't find... what?
I don't think it's negative five.
Do that again.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Ashley, Jesus --
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
You motherfucker.
Get the hell off of me!
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
They've never done a robbery?
Get your own room, Ashley.
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
They'll have guns.
He says he wants it now.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
No, you can't --
Put him in the truck.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
Hell. Ten?
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
You do.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
Got something to say to me, Nick?
NO.
You gotta be kidding me.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
...so where is he?
I can't go back to Vegas...
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
Cancer-sucker.
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Rudy, don't move --
GUARD! GUARD!
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
POP! That was My card!
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I don't wanna lift crates.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
I'll call somebody.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
I don't know, but somebody did.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
Who, Mr. White?
Me and Mr. White?
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
Didja use the commode story?
Jesus Christ!
Just hold on buddy boy.
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Give me this fucking thing.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Aren't you?
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Why?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
What happened?
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
As opposed to good?
What's wrong with it?
No real people?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
So what is it?
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
Tell them to come on in.
Anybody hurt?
And this is Helen Carter.
Yes, ma'am.
Our kind of women?
And this is Helen Carter.
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
We can't stay here!
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Tell me, darling.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
I found their surrey --
I -- lost something.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
What did you come back for?
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
Stop it -- stop it.
What is it?
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
Even women?
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
And you're all alone.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
You're not giving up?
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Good night, Miss Wells.
What comes after Z?
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
Hey, Brenda.
Me, too. 101?
Really? That's amazing.
Thanks.
Cindy, what's going on?
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Where's Shorty?
I meant you're into ghosts.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Maybe we can study together or something.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Let's get outta here.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
What about you, Buddy?
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Better try a little higher.
Listen to me I --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Okay, I get the point.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Stop touching his brain!
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
It was you...
What the hell are you doing?
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Got a problem with that?
I don't like this, this...
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
Professor!
Would you please focus?
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Alright... I might need your help.
Would you like to see the girl?
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
No thanks.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Yo son, check this out.
I woke up naked, too.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Mrs. Sutphin?
Bring her home... I guess.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Chip, honey?
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
He goes to college with me!
Chip, your ride is here.
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
What did you just say?
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
He killed people, Mom.
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Certainly not!
Murder, honey.
What is it, Betty?
You know who I am, August?
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
You scared?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
About forty-five dollars.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
What did she want?
And that was all?
What did she want to know?
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
But I'd give a great deal to know.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
The people at the restaurant?
Please —- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
Who the devil is he?
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
But I'm not joking.
Could you find him?
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
And you knew he'd be here.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one — so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her -— he doesn't make her laugh —— he just sits and talks.
And the other was Judd?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
I'm afraid not.
But she was here?
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
No, I think you look... fine.
Well...
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
So what about kids?
Of course not.
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
Hi!
Are you in the middle of something?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Donna?
No.
Like what?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Tell me your name.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Is he going to see this?
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
About me?
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
Her name was Elizabeth.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
You're really never going to make love again?
I can't.
I've told you.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Who? Elizabeth?
But that was part of it?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Come on!!
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Yes. I just got busy.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
What upsets you about that?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
God, no.
No, he left last week.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
What?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
What are you talking about?
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Lose something?
I just thought it might --
Fine.
No, it's nothing like that.
What!?
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
In front of him, Ann, yes.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
Thank you.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
Do I know you?
The extrovert.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
You just want to ask me questions?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Prettier than Ann?
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
It won't. I trust him.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Plenty of room for two people.
Plus first and last month deposit.
Everybody has a past.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
Answer him, goddammit!!
May I ask who's calling?
Mr. Millaney?
Hi.
Jesus!
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Kiss, kiss?
Well? Supper at my place?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Didn't seem worried about them.
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
He didn't make it.
BREAKING OUT
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
How's Brad?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
When do I get to see Brad?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
SPONSOR!!!
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
In a way...
A free thinker.
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Care to indulge?
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
I'm not going, Janet.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
I'd forgotten.
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
Could you tell us a little about it?
Could I do that later?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
No!  He's never done that before.
BRAD!
F for...
F for...
Our speciality.
That's an extremely negative response.
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Why are you being so defensive?
Bye.
How's the trip?
What do you think?
Glass or bottle?
You got it.
You okay, Miles?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
Hiya.
Highliner, please.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
This is rose, right?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Perfect.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Right now.
What'd Christine say?
Where is Stephanie?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Call me on my cell if you go out.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
What do you think's going on?
With Maya.
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
What?
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
Do you like them?
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
You know what I'm thinking?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Yep. Quite a day.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
What the fuck!
Look at this!
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Are you all right?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Is she sleeping or...?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Oh. You mean... today?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Can I ask you a personal question?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Okay. See you around.
I had class.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Where are you?
Hello?
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Should we get dessert?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
It makes me feel better.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
The same windows.
...Tell Graham --
You do?
It was very dark.
It was very dark.
Pharmacy crowded?
He was only a year and half old.
We won't be able to get out of there.
How many died?
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
I'm getting out now.
What about Isabelle?
It's not broken.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
Is he okay?
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
All I did was kiss a girl.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
Emmett.
I didn't know you were out.
Forget it.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
Are you all right?
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Offend anybody lately?
South of here, past Chimayo.
What's Turley like?
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
What happened?
What about the law?
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Get out of here, Jake.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
New record.
You can't do this.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
The jury saw it differently.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
He was murdered.
Why come to me?
What's stopping you?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
Yeah, it's working out real good.
Hello, Cobb.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
What brings you into my saloon?
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I thought we talked about that.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
How about you?
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- It's called a projector.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
Why not?
Hair and make-up?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
There isn't one.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
... Simone.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Thank Simone for the tickets.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
She still with Kent?
There was no other way.
You know, I... don't know.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Okay, Dad.
One thing bothered me.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
She thinks you're with Simone.
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I know what you're up to.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
What now, Sayer?
Is it a jamming device?
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
Mr. Sayer...
It's a hotel.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Good morning, Simone.
Maybe he can.
You did create me.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
Don't step in the horse manure.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
What'd you write?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Yes.
What makes you think that?
When they get mad, it gets cold.
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
--What?
Dr. Crowe?
Something happened, didn't it?
Are you wigging out?
Don't go home, okay?
They're right here.
I'd give anything to have been there.
You know that accident up there?
They?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
Yes, Cole?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
What--
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Good for you.
'Course, it's none of my business.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Fuck you.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Suzie???
Looks like the alternator.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Come on --
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Sounds familiar.
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
So... what does it do?
Should we be doing this, dude?
He means moon shining.
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
You'll be back.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Ow!
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Getting ready.
You wouldn't understand.
Suzie --
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p-please...
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
And that makes you look like a squid?
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
That wasn't a good night, no.
He's a fucking Martian?!
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
I'll get if for you.
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
When one sees you they all see you.
Where'd he go?
Praise Jesus.
You.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Why? You have a bowling date?
So tell me about yourself.
Well?...
What the hell's going on?
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
I'm proud of you.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Or in the slammer.
No.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Loud and clear.
He's history.
Shit! No one's here.
Liquid gold.
You know how to drive one of these things?
I hate to say I told you so.
You can't swear on these.
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
Do I have a choice?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
-- How we doing?
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Have any trouble getting here?
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
Bandit two, you read me?
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Did he give you his name?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
But there were more of you?
Are you on a land line?
I'm here, where's the car?
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
It's the last place they'd look.
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...When did you know all this?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
I wouldn't go that far.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
... Jesus... what for?
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
Bulllllshit...
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
Gibarian.
No?  Who am I, then?
No.  There's no behavior modification.
You fucking bastard...
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
How long can you go without sleep?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
What happened?
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
What do you want?
What plan?
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Don't.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
What happened?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
But we fought.
Why did she do it?
Was she right?
You're the coward.
Do you want to stay here?
That won't happen again.  We're different.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
You never said you wanted one.
You're lying.
Where did you go before?
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
What did he say?
You live in Manhattan?
Would you pick one out, please?
You can touch me, I won't bite.
You all right?
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
What about Neil?
You could do better.
You put me life in danger.
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop, will you?!
I don't know you...
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Are you okay?
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
It wouldn't work.
How long you going away for?
So.
I'll miss you, Mike.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Mike?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Bought it.
She took you shopping for a tie?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
What about when she goes out?
At my house...!
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
Who's Joey Venza?
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
Yes.
Hold it...!
Let my kid go.
Watch your step!
How about dinner tonight?
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Peter-- you took this picture?
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Lizzy!
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Would you cool it already?
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Some things you should say anyway.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
You'd feel what?
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
I'm a photographer, remember?
The record--
Poison emergency.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
How much do you know about it?
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
They never caught on.
What's wrong with him?
Jawohl!
What's the match gag?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
There's only one pair left.
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
You make my mouth water.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Let's blow, Chauncey.
I'll live.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
You can say that again!
No, Animal.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
Stay out of it, Sefton.
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Right.
You off your rocker?
You taking Dunbar?
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Ach so!
December seventh, forty-one.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
It's working.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
Data, are you all right?
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
Are any of them inhabited?
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
Antonia?
Yes.  Thank you.
But I do have a theory...
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Is there a problem?
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
I don't believe it...
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
My readings indicate great instability.
Later. Let's go...
Did your collaborator know?
This planet is aging in surges.
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Captain, what's happening?!
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Mr. Scott?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
What happened...?
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
I know you... Do I not?
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
We are clear and free to navigate.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Would you look at that?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
Genesis, I want it.
Yes, I was...
But -- why?
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
How can you tell that?
Firing range, sir.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
You're not going in there -- !
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Say thank you.
Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
It never rains but when it pours --
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
They even killed the galley chief.
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
It's the Genesis Wave!
I didn't expect anything.
It was just words.
What are you looking at?
They're still running with shields down.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
Well?
Time's up, Admiral...
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
Scotty -- what's left?
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Carol Marcus --
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Uh oh.
... the good of the few...
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
I did not think so.
Khan!
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Admiral on the bridge --
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
I would accept that as an axiom.
Heard there was some excitement.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
That's crazy!
Oh, joy.
Wake up, man, wake up!
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Can you isolate the wave?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
The top of what?
Go ahead. Stun me.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Back to San Francisco.
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
Thanks.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
Then --
Or believe, I'll bet.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
How will that be done, exactly?
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
Thanks. Cheers.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
It's true... what you said...
Steady, now. We need your help.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Permission to come aboard.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
What is our condition?
Ready sir.
What is it?
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Estimate range, ship to whales!
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
I'll have to re-energize.
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
Will it?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
Jak'tahla?
Don't you ever get tired?
Really.
Do machines ever play?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
I'll order Riker to turn around.
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
I do not take orders from you.
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Counselor?
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Initiate launch sequence.
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
Montana.  Energize.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
It's Cochrane.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
You actually performed surgery...?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
How long has he been unconscious?
Is it Japanese?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
Dispersive armor is holding.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
I have helm control.
Juice?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Jean-Luc Picard.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
Invasion.
I'd say you already have.
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Captain...?
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Report!
Emergency override!
Report.
Wil... Data was down there.
Worf to Bridge.
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Even Data?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Spock, that was actually funny.
Specifically of...?
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
We're explorers not diplomats!
This is fun...
Retire.
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
I was nervous -
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
My God, what happened here?
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Just the size of my head -
Torpedo room--?
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Your friends are late...
We don't get many presidential assassins.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Stand down your weapons.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Aft thrusters -
I always wanted to try that.
Who is "US?"
Just the prototype.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
According to my information, today.
Me?
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
What is it?
But I am not human. I am only -
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Any progress?
Direct hit -
Praxis?
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
A computer canna lie, sir.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
- could take weeks, sir.
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Brother. I cannot move.
When was he... created?
Remember him?
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
Data!
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Yes, sir.
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Ready, Captain.
How long until we reach the fleet?
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
Why am I looking at me?
Why?
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
Yes.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
Counselor.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
I'm going to miss you.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
You're not here.
No.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
With or without the rest of the fleet?

It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
I won't do it.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Why don't they answer our hails?
It's working.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Sir?
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
You don't trust me.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Looking up at the stars.
All of this so you could capture me?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
The bond is broken.
How long until we reach the Rift?
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
How many Warbirds will you need?
But surely...
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
What can I do for you folks?
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
What do you do?
Make any money?
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Where did you stop last?
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
Clarify that.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
No deal.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Steering wheel...
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
What?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
What?
I want to try it.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
But I must go here.
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
What happened?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Yes.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What are you doing?
I like this music.
Do you have music up there?
Put that back.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
Where are you going?
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
You are cold.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
They are beautiful.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
The cook again?
What will you say about us?
This is yours...
The yellow one.
What do I do now?
I love you.
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
I told you I'm looking for someone.
I don't know where he is.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
I don't understand.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Jesus.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
Clips.
What?  Right Here?
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
Let's work it.
So've I.  Too much.
Faith OK?
Jesus.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Charm.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
What the fuck are you doing?
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Jesus, Lenny.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
And gives it to you.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
No it doesn't.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
Where we going?
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
There's a plus side?
It was a tough call.
Who's Strickland?
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
I guess.
Got your ticket?
Take it to him.
Are we under arrest?
Right.  That explains it.
What is that?
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Have you had a chance to think about --
No.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
You tell me.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
You heard?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
How do you feel, Agent
I'm hesitant to...
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Thanks for the ride.
None taken.
You work with Koessler?
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
It's a no-no.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Jesus.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
You were right. He found me.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
I don't carry it with me.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
Is he dead?
[Lionheart, what happened?]
If I owe, I will go.
Let's talk about Zero.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
I want to go live with you.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Koessler?
Speck is dead.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
You should call your Grandmother.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Are you sure? Maybe...
Well, thank you...?
Hi.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
How?
What else?
To do what?
Anything?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
The poor thing. Six years?
He's so sweet. He really said that?
Do you have anything smaller?
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
Why not?
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Me too.
I'll be around.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...well, it suits you...
Hi. Sorry about that.
How's it going? It's been a while...
I miss you, Mike.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
Well that sucks.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Unless she comes back first.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
I mean, I need the money.
You want to hit the town tonight?
Sounds more like Aids...
Kinda money, huh?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
Oh, like that song...
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Mike?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
Cut that shit out.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
You gotta do it.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
What was the part?
No!
I don't think so.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
No.
You guys are such assholes.
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
Which one?
What are you doing?
We got the digits, baby.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
What the fuck..?
Because he's a bitch.
Oh, it's on, baby...
Is she looking at me, baby?
Yes she did.
It's on.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...shivering...
...You're just poking at it...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
It is on.
Sorry man.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
Eat it, it's on the table.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
I'll think about it.
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
You take care of your family?
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
You mean Tattaglia.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
Godfather, you understand everything.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
You tell us about America.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
We should hear what they have to say.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
What about McCluskey?
Michael, what are those men doing?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
You really want to know?
Then the legs at the knees...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
What time do they expect us?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
Is he alive?
How do you do.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
You'd say if you mind?
Marge, you like everybody.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
He's drowning me!
You know, a primer.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Do you have any brothers?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
Shoes too?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Ha.
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
Who is it?
What about Christmas?
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Hardly.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
Yes it is.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
I never said that!
Are you okay?
Hello Marge.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
How long's he staying for?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Where does Dickie live?
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Look at me what?
Did Dickie's Dad go?
I found Dickie's rings.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
I told you. He gave them to me.
It's all true.
What?
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
What's funny?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
What did he say?
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Not guilty.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Hello. What are you up to?
How was it?
Or Tom and Peter even.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even her.
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
It is a little coarse, yes.
I have!
How much to get a permit to carry?
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
What hours do you work?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
But this is a porno movie.
Damn.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Travis?
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
How long has he been there?
Oh, are you all right?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
No, why?
He's Black, OK?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
Betsy, come over here a moment.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Stick up?
Yeah. From the likes of them.
What's your name?
That ain't much of a name.
No.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
God, you are square.
You a narc?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
Why should it be grounded?
Got your license?
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
So I hear.
No.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Wiz?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Yeah.
Like do anything, you know.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
Thank you.
Spit it out.
Limp dick?
Mason.  Mason?
Partners?
God's speed.
Hi.
I believe you.
What about you, Delly?
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
Do you... remember me?
What.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
Whoa.
What did... what did I want to be?
What was that?
Nine hundred...
They're not bad.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
I see...
Sir, that is true.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Here we are.
No wallet, huh?
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Why?
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Ernie.
Well...
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Jesus...
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Any idea how you got here, son?
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Here, one of mine.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
Evening, Luke.
You kids off to the dance?
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Exactly.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Would you like some brandy?
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
I don't understand.
I did.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Is anyone there?
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Yes, I did.
Mother!
Don't you like us?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
I wonder if you could help me.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Do you know him?
Yes, but where?
The two kids?
I see. How do I get down there?
Thank you.
Are you sure?
I need her exact name, you see.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
A what?
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Whose side are you on?
Well... well, is everyone all right?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
I can handle it.
They won't be.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
No.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
I couldn't ask you to.
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
He was killed last night. By birds.
Sixty...  Oh.
I wonder if you could help me.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Doesn't what make me...?
How?
Ouch!
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
We... we went to school together. College.
Oh, no you don't!
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
You like me, huh?
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
What did it say?
But you tore it up.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken.
I think it's safe to get out now.
The town looks clear.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
Where are they heading?
When will they stop?
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
There we are!
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
For what purpose?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
How do you plan to do that?
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I'm only a student.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Dr. MacFarlane --
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
What's that you say?
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
This is not a woman!
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
No.
It might be an interesting case.
Toddy hates me.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
But why, Gray? Why?
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
You're not going to Gray.
I hate that picture.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
We won't.
You think I'm crazy.
The strip joint?
That was a fucking hollow point!
Think maybe knives do?
You killed her. I saw it.
What did they give you?
What did they give you?
I heard you were looking for this.
I was a friend of your sister's.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
Daisy. How did you know?
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Just don't believe everything you see.
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
Erin!
What? What is it?
You're in with them.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
Hi Mom!
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
He gave these to you?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Are you an FBI man?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
You think they'll ever find him?
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
What does that mean?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
I wonder if we ought to--
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
I was.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
You sure about that?
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
I don't like horror comics.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
I don't like horror comics.
All day.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
They're gaining on us!
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Shut up!
We were gonna grab some food.
Don't!  Stop!
Where's Star, David?!
With him?
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
I thought they'd be in coffins.
David.
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Are we havin' fun or what?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
It was a dream, Star.
See you later.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Okay?
We are...
Tell them to get something to eat.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
What did you say?
This looks terrific, Lucy.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
I am?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Ouch.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
When?
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Then it's not too late for us...
Huh?
This is kind of a cool place.
Go away.
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Did you spill something?
Mom's home?...
Michael?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
What's the matter?
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
What?
Let's open it.
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
MacReady!
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
You ain't tying me up.
I think so.
Hey, Sweden!!!
And if anyone tries to wake me...
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
After all this mess then.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
How long's it been?
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
What if it doesn't come?
He might just wait us out.
What's happened?!
Yeah!
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
Send him away.
Machines?
What's your name?
No, we created the Morlocks.
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
So you take their best...
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Talk away, Professor.
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
I can't do that --
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
Did you hear me, lad?
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
His curiosity is amazing.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
The mud carriers.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Alexander...?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Might I ask why?
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
Yes, sir.
And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
You won't even try?
My fowl have polluted the yard.
If I might explain, sir --
Yes, sir.
What did you do at night?
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
But... what about Starks?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Relax.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
And what's that?
Who are you?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
What're those?
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I gave you my dog tags.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Do you really believe me?
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
What about the world?
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
It's gonna be sticky.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Well, where are you from?
Of course you don't know.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Have a good day at work today.
Hon?
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Why?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Who do you think did it?
I've been better.
We're both fine.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
What kind of gun was it?
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
Oh shit.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Louise, is that you?
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
Tell me.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Is that how you answer the phone?
Hey, peaches.
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
Is this your car?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Thelma!
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Louise.  Where are we going?
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
But you think he fools around.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
That's puttin' it mildly.
What happened to your hair?
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Drive!  Drive away!
You think you've found your calling?
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
I want you to call Darryl.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
What little dogs?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
What'd I say again?
Louise?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
He said they're charging us with murder.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We can live in a hacienda.
We've gone insane.
How far are we from Mexico?
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
You're a good friend.
You women are crazy!
We're fine!  How are you?
Oh, Jesus!
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Gay? He said you were gay?
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
It must be great with a wife like that.
Mary again.
Why not?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
No You mean...?
Shoot.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Got cash.
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Dom? What are you?
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
The sawbones?
Oh yeah.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
I know he's around here someplace.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Are you okay?
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
All you want is a phone number?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
I'd go with the seven.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Meaning?
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
So who's the lucky guy?
What's a mook?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Holy shit...
Pat's an architect, too.
Pat does projects all over the world.
Can I pour you one?
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
So who you taking to the prom?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
By the way, how's he doing?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Hey.
What's that?
Sure.
Now by killer, you mean...?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
So you're a writer?
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
One guess.
No! I was pissing!
Franks and beans!
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
Max.
How long until the army is ready?
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
How's my favorite President?
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
So what've we got today?
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
I don't like what's happening.
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
What's that?
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
What'd she say?
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
What are you --
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
What's he smoke in that?
What did he say?
So what?
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
That's not solid.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Jesus. Oil?
He's gone.
Thank you.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
Your relatives must've taught you something.
Washington sent ya. I know that.
No way. No fuckin' way.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
I'll bet!
Yeah, most likely.
You saw a MiG 21?
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
Harmless!
Why'd you do that?
It dies. We live.
That's true. What are you?
You don't have to kill it.
You ever think about killing another human being?
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
You're totally insane.
Lucky charm.
...they say you're alright.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
What kind of games?
What does it mean?
Looks like a tie.
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
This is crazy!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
What are you doing?
I know!
I've got it -- hold on!
Gotta go, man.
What do you want?
Let me do the talking.
So I've heard.
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
What are you doing?
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
What the hell is this?
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
That's Kazanski.
I was a victim of circumstance.
Mav's a great flyer but....
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
You saved our lives. You did it!
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
You won?!!!
It was bad.
Morning, Coogan.
Was going.  Now you are.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
Or you can quit.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
What's wrong with this one?
Welcome to Mars.
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
What do you want?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
He had help.  From our side, sir.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
Two-headed monsters?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
I'm listening.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
No shit...
Hey, Quaid!
Harry, what the hell is this?
I've got a weak signal over there.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
I suppose you're not here either.
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
No options.
Secret agent...How much is that?
Why would I lie to you?
I think you better leave.
I thought you didn't like me.
Now what?
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Like what?
He's lying.
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Wait!
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
What the hell is that, anyway?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
Jeez, look at that guy.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Fuck you!
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Son of a bitch!
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Burt!  Heather!
What?
You sure this is where it was?
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Gimme back my bottle.
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
I noticed.
"We"?
You see that? You wanna be like that?
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
-- an angel dust dealer --
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
That DD-5.
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
A fucking wheelchair?
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
I embellished.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
A fucking wheelchair?
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
'lo, Cecil.
Edward T. Dowd.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
You getting this?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
CIA?
No... No, go away.
No.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
The stuff we got last night.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Is there a golf course around here?
OK, Gordon.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
And no one found the ring?
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
He's dead -- good and dead.
No.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
I see. He does talk loud.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
Agent Desmond, it's...
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
Take a look at this.
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Noooo...
Are you going to see James tonight?
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Oh god, Laura.
Laura?
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
You missed somethin', Ed.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
Did you make me a tape?
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
We're on our way, Baby.
It does matter. We're in love.
What's going on?
You always hurt the ones you love.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
When he finds out.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
I hate asparagus.
Where's Dad?
Good night, Mom.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
Let me see.
Who was that?
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
Come back as soon as you can.
Four cases in three years...
...tell me about this case.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
We thought it was just.
Yes.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
...he wants to testify...?
You know what that would mean?
This is going to drive the ante up.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
Just now...
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
...of Anesthesiology?
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
Thank you. When Debby...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
It's all right, Mickey.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Dr. Thompson...?
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
I'm sorry...?
The most respected...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Hi.
Mrs. Simmonds.
One hour.
A single hour.
I need an extension for my case.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
Well, then what are you doing here?
Not if you don't grow up...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
You know what happened.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Then why don't you testify?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
Another, Frank...?
It's a long road that has no turning.
...hey, I don't need your charity...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
What?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Hey, there - open up!
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
There's nobody left around here now.
Is that it over there?
The troops are certainly moving in here!
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
We will, sir!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
They don't do much of anything...!
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
You mean that was a...
And I...I've got other things happening.
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
One of mom's cups got broken.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
What if it isn't over?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Does he have to stay here over night?
Doctor...
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
Tomorrow night.
And...what's the man doing?
Do you have to die to see God?
Home.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
You okay?
When do you think it'll be done?
What...happened?
Really?
You got it.  What's happening?
Holy...
Heather Langenkamp?
I want to see the body.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Heather, what is it?
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
Captured?  How?
Then what is he doing?
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
No, not really.  I...
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
Why did we begin this?
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Carry on.
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
Where's Mom?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
Feels different doesn't it?
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
I thought this was your dream come true.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
But that's not the point...
I feel like I got you into this.
It works?
That's how he died you know.
What are they doing?
I can't go in there.
You all right?
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
But you invited is aboard.
Is that what you were trained to do?
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
What?!  What's happening?!!
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
Me, too.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
What?  Come on...
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
What do you think?
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
How long you been standing there?
Suicidal...
Swing up, son.
What's it going to be?
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
No.
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
What's she doin' here?
Why should it?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
That is my permiso.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Hasta siempre.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
What?
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
What's that honey?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
Sailor!
They sure do stink.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
What's that, honey?
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
Oh shit...
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
Sailor?
That you, Sail, honey?
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
Sail?
I mean tomorrow.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Course I am, mama.
Six.
What do you want me to do about it?
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Just tell me what you want.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Through the forehead?
You got nice tits.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
By who?
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
You snore.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Thank you.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
I just mean...
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
He has a book.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Not Curtis.
That was good.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Tripp?!
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
How are you -- is it Joe?
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
I'll be... somewhere else.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
I've been trying to finish a book...
Boy or girl?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Yes. But that's not why I called...
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Really? That's remarkable.
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
They're glass. The buttons.
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Want me to get that?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
How did I get here last night?
She seemed to take it pretty well.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
The one that left you?
Maybe she didn't come here.
So, why did you take me up there?
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Want a bite?
When?
Where you going?
I'm not going, with them.
Near Carvel?
Get out of here.
So what are you going to do?
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
But where? I need the street.
He cribbed that from Borges.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
Well...
Who's gun is that?
I'm kidding. Hello?
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Sara.
And the jacket?
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
I know.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
That's a nice greenhouse.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
Excuse me?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Yo, Traxler.
Maybe I should read it.
Where's Emily, Hank?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
There's so many...
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
Cherry.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
Ah, come on.
C'mon, Walter.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
Carlos, can I ask you something?
What do you mean?
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
You always carry these?
Something like that.
You should hear the bird.
Were you watching me?
Don't you have friends?
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
I haven't broken any laws.
I would.
Doesn't everybody?
Okay?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
You walked home.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
You don't know?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
Have you seen Walter?
Robin?
No thank you.
What's her name?
Why not?
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
How do you feel about that?
You have no feelings for your niece?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Do you think you're crazy?
Is that what you are angry about?
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
You're very late.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
Who do you see?
Where are you?
But roughly, how old?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
There's something wrong with this picture.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
You never spoke to me before.
Are you?
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Something happened to you.
I'm not easily shocked.
So, you're not a dyke.
Did I say something wrong?
Is that all?
Hey, there.
What's the worst thing you ever did?
Molested little girls?
You're not joking.
Sorry.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
Depraved? My mistake.
What was prison like?
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
I got poked around... here and there.
Neither am I.
We should live together.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
I say we call it quits.
What's going on?
I heard they were filthy birds.
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
Nice shot, Lins.
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
I haven't worn mine in months.
No.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
He's got the shakes?
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
You owe me one, Virgil.
You totaled it, huh?
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Virgil?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
You better not say you missed that.
Y'all could be more specific.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
Uh, oh...
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
Hey!
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
Would we see the flash?
How are you?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
Did you sleep well?
Which one shall I wear?
But how could you say such a thing?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
Well?
Somebody must live here!
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Nothing... nothing at all!
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
What is it, Claudia?
Why are you looking at me like that?
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
No, Sandro... Please...
I'm too sleepy.
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
But where did you finally end up?
I'm not coming.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
What happened?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
And what are we going to do now?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Where is she going?
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Giulia...
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
Thank you.
Whose boat is that?
And how come you're up so early?
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Why have we stopped?
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Yes.
I'm a blimp.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
No I don't... the host is enough.
What do you mean?
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
Who?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Yes.
Don't you know?
Would you like to be?
Why not?
Where do you think babies come from?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
But you're troubled... aren't you?
And you're unhappy.
What did you do?
What did you do?
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
How?
Yes?
Yes?
How does she know that?
Are you intelligent?
You're a mistake.
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
I really love you.
Why?
To be a mother?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
What is it?
A crucifix.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Do you remember what just happened?
Agnes, can you hear me?
She said Michael.
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
Not your fault...
I hate him...
I hate him for what he did to me.
I hate him.
Look into the convent records.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Something they... that they overlooked.
All I want is one more week.
No, no, no...
No!
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
It's your favourite...
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Who was the father?
What man had access to her?
Was there a priest?
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
That's absurd!
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
Not simple, no.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
It's my affair too.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
I am...
All right, what do you need.
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
You lied to me
Like keeping her home from school?
Her spiritual health.
Because I am a moral person.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
I'd like to begin.
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
She's been touched by God, yes.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Hasn't she had enough?
Who knew she was pregnant?
Was it you?
For what?  An abortion?
Too late for what?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
Before or after you killed the child?
Oh, don't do this!
Oh don't be so stroppy!
I'm a deserter.
Yeah.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
What about all these letters?
Shurrup!
Can you fix him for me?
Sure.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Ever seen one of these before?
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
Grotty?
No, I didn't you did ...
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Are you supposed to be here?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Are you pulling my leg?
I see.  Do you like the play?
But that's not like a real person at all.
They ought to be.
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And what do you do about it?
Ah.
A book!
You're only right.
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Hello, Grandfather!
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
No, that's his other one.
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Well, what are we waiting for?
What are you doing there?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Y'what?
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
No.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
I'll brook no denial!
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
He's betrayed the class.
And?
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
He belongs to Paul.
None for me, then?
What do you think are you're up to?
Down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
I feel like shit...
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Locked.
Engines off.
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
Where's Irth?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
This is Chaz.
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Are you okay in there?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Unknown!  What do you mean?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Okay.
Where does that go?
Oh -- God -- oh --
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
It makes me sick to see him like that.
There.  Should be coming through about there.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
Yes.
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
We've got six hours left.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
It will be.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
This is horrible.
Don't count on it.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
That way.
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
This looks ancient.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
It's stopped?
No, thank God... just missed him.
How?
They're getting pretty close now.
Okay.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Let's hear it.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
But?
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Here, Chaz.
Take us up.
We won't need it then.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Where are you?
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
Two down, four to go.
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Let's get back and call this in.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
Seal everything now!
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
When?
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
De Vries?
Something spooking the rhinos?
Whoa, wait a minute...
Forget it, man.
But I'm going first...
Still got him?
Wait.  Lost it.
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
And...?
There's still time to back-out.
Okay, we're in business.
What is that?
Seltzer?
What?
How's it going?
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
How do you know my name?
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
You take charge.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
What a day - what a heavenly day...
Aren't you?
You sat and talked until it was light...
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
That's not true!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
I'm tired. I want to go home.
Let's go sit by the piano.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
Feeling better, my dear?
Naturally enough, your understudy.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Didn't you know?
Just slipped your mind.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
Bill!
Macbeth.
When? When are you going to do it?
You're my girl, aren't you?
Then you're crazy.
You in a hurry?
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
She did...?
Okay.
I'll check with Eve...
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Need any help?
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
So she seems.
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Addison-!
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Paranoiac!
Well, I am.
Hello, what's your name?
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Why?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Every day.
Thanks for your help... good luck.
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
- and for you.
You think?
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
You need new girdles.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
You don't like Eve, do you?
An answer.
Late for what?
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
How long does it take?
That's the door.
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
She's got to meet you-
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
If I only knew how...
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
You're not going, are you?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
May I have your coat?
Oh, but there is-
Eve... don't cry.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
Addison wants me to play it.
She knows enough not to be here.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
I've got it.
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
He's in love with you.
With tears?
Coming?
It's just possible she didn't...
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
You'll break your neck on that ice.
Eve.
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
Would you, really? How sweet-
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Don't be evasive.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
"Liebestraum."
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
When's the audition?
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
You get quick action, don't you?
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
And?--And?--
Were you eyebrow reading?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
--there had to be a White House overseer--
Goddamnit--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Nah.  Maybe.
What's the matter?
--Jesus--
Morning or night?
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
Tell that to Muskie.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Can't help you.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--no--
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
I thought you had to get to Miami.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
You've really got to go.
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
What happens when the baby comes?
Same kind of crap--
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
I got Clawsen on hold--
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
What?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
There were more then.
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Where in government?
Where?
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Who's Colson, Harry?
So?
Anything?
What else have you got?
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
Mr. Sloan?
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
What the hell was that?
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Good morning gentleman.
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
This.  Right now.
Not bad, Chris.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
You don't like it?
What?!
I wasn't making fun of you.
Onions?
So we're gonna be close next year?
You're missing the game for us?!
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
...I've never tried it.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
Give it to me!  Yes!
Fuck me!  Yes!
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
But, but -- what would I do?
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Holy shit.
How do you know that?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
Yes dad.
Yes.
What was your name again?
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
...excuse me?!
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
This was remade?  Into what?
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Yes.  No.  Yes.
Jim...
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Hey...
Yeah Vick?
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Say that again, Kevin?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Then she said -- she loves me.
Contact, dude.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
NOVA!!
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
<u>Yeah</u>!
Here, babe.
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
God. How can you eat like that?
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Like an underground club?
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Fan-fucking-tastic?
This looks familiar...
Hello?
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
They're coming!
I hope they fucking fry us all.
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
I know where he'll go.
Oh God. Shit...
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
Nothing's happening!
Not you too -
Uncle Terrence?
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Claude.
Jesus...
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Enough. Cut him loose.
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Where is your home, Anya?
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Poor Meetoo!
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
You must enjoy causing me pain!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Oh! I'm sorry...
Anya, wait!
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
And this is my future. This is who I am!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
You're a princess...
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
You're like New York. You're an island.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
The alarm clock.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
He was creepy.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
So sorry.
For yuh.
All right.
Oh, right.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Your grammy!
Fifteen years?
Oh, sorry.
Neat?
Well, who's Sadie?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Why not?
Oh, thank you.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Gimme a kiss.
Yeah?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
I know you've only known me a short while.
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Really?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Well, what is your definition of following?
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah.
David! David! I can't believe this!
I'm following you and David, if you-
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Happy birthday.
Remember, we had that thing.
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
God, it's so clean out here.
Christ!
God.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
What?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Bad?
Man, that's great. That's just great.
I can think of another word.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
You like this house, Max?
The one with the V.P.L.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
You fired the cleaning woman?
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Oh, gosh.
There's a whole wing in this house.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Had a little help?
Isn't Skye amazing?
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
I don't know how to make her funny.
What what's about?
Oh.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Directing suits you.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
But she's alright.
Stupid tart.
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
Whatever you say.
Yes.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
No luck.
No.  Did you?
What?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
You want me to uninvite her?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
In the kitchen.
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
Two minutes.
Not properly watered.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
About me!
I don't look my age, Joe.
Cal, too?
Anyone else?
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
Yes, she is.
Yes I did.
And I you.
You lose this?
And Ryan works at home.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
I didn't say a word.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
We could hardly say no.
I'm so sorry.
I...
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
I was impressed.
The Shostakovich.
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Shit!
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
You're my best friend.
Panes?
What did I do?
I didn't know you had this.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
He's a novelist.
Nevermind.
She's such a great photographer.
It's much more personal in here.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
Someone who follows his heart!
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
You're right!
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
What <u>was</u> that thing?
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Water...water...
We're going to die!
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
So what makes you so special?
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Come on, Z.
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
Why do they have you tied up here?
Of course --
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
...Not enough food?
May I cut in?
Ask me why we're so successful.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Ma'am?
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
Oh, I never catch colds.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
One more?
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
Here.
Here. How about some breakfast?
Who?
What's your friend's name?
Something wrong with your legs?
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Cut.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
No doubt about it.
Thank you.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
I mean, after that?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I never thought he'd do it.
I guess so.
Are you all right?
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Last night?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
You do?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
Well -- I guess so.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
Put me down for Thursday again.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
Yeah --
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
Yes, sir.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Hi, Baxter.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
You threatening me?
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
Yeah, wasn't I?
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
Who is Mickey?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
And what happened to you?
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
Please -- just let me sleep.
Yes, I know.
I missed you, Fran.
It's been hell.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Remember what we talked about?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Are you there, Fran?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
What are you talking about?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Did you have a nice Christmas?
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Where are you headed?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
We need all our fuel anyway.
How about a drink ?
That's good gin.
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Holy shit.
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
Charlie?
What are we doing here?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
Can I go get those mangos now?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Get in there !
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
I only met Kurtz once.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
Who is he?
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
We don't want to bother you any, we --
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Where've you been riding, Lance?
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
What do you mean?
How big it is?
Change.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
What's the furthest you been in?
What'd you do for supplies?
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
I think think a lie stinks.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
I had immense plans.
Yes...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
He'll kill us.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Who are you?
Cognac?
What will you do after the war?
Yes.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
What show ?
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
134  CONTINUED:
119  CONTINUED:  
165  CONTINUED:  
165  CONTINUED:  
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
212  CONTINUED:
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Oh.
You should know something.
Have you talked to Eric?
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
What are you doing?
I'll go into town with you.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
Let's go.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
What's going on?
Where's Corbett?
You're hurt.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
Told you I'm fine!
Stay still.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
I already have.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Can you walk?
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
If Corbett's men find out --
Alleged killer.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
Why the smirk?
He saw you and Corbett come in...
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Thought that door was open last night...
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
It's Sam Wilder!
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Me. My home number is on this card.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Sorry.
Oh, please...
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
What's this?
Nice of you... thank you.
No, sir...
The stiff one eye?
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
I was going to do that for you.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
That seems like a good choice.
The two might go together.
I should've danced with you.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
Help!
You changed the room around...
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
Which color was that?
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
I brought you Chinese soup.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
That's very thoughtful.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
Not it at all, really.
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
I told you to go on in.
You going to come talk to me or not?
Because...  ... you love her?
Uh, Fontella's
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
What does that fucking mean?
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
I'm on the scent.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
I don't know what the fuck you are.
I know what happened.
I work for the government.
Bullshit.
I don't need the money.
How?
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Electra.
Had?
I killed him.
I was just different.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
My first take?
About?
No.
Do you think about the game?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Do you think he's here?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
I don't believe that.
What happened?
What did he want?
I think I got one today.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
I went into their room this afternoon.
Nobody ever sees me.
That's a ridiculous move.
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
What happened to her?
Did you --
Was she the only one?
Is this becoming complicated?
Uh-huh.
I waited another four minutes.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
I'm taking off my mike.
You're very good at this aren't you?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
For what?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Then, I'll sail alone.
Thank you.
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Can I ask you something?
Of course, senor.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
Cheers Katka!
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
Anything in it?
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
And put it on expenses?
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Tell them we're working for the University.
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Nope.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
So why didn't we?
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Chris! Tell me some good news.
I don't want to ruin your day.
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
Take this exit.
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
There shooting at something.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
She's tired.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
They'll do it.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
About forty minutes.
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Will they free me?
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Who you saving the dishes for?
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
So, he didn't fire you?
I think we should be going honey.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
That's my bag.
It's more than what you're worth.
Why are there still such headlines?
You are responsible...What has happened?
What are you an idiot!
So, who is in the building?
She's coming over here...
She asleep?
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
Out with Belinda?
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
I'm thinking.
Don't call him a dipshit.
Deranged.
She's like some Puritan.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
You.
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
'I hope your dreams come true.'
That's deep --
I know you don't want help.
Yeah.
You got some kind of list?
No problem --
I know. Don't say anything.
Looking for intelligent life?
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
The play's going to be really good.
All of it.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
She great or what?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
It's only 7:30.
Excuse me?
Come on.
Are you trying to seduce me?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
From citizen high to citizen low.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
Nope.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
By accident --
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Landon. You go on home.
You have materials for the side bearings?
Shall I give you a few ideas?
For Jefferson High. For books.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
This is 1952....?
What's N.R.C.?
How old are you?
It's polyester.
You remember me...?
Then you'll be going to school here....?
Oh yeah.
The sunrise? What for?
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
Operator...
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
What?!
Eight thirty.
But Professor --
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
A gold mine?
Marty, that would alter history.
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
You answered the door!
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
What theater was I at?
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
That's what he told you, huh?
I'll catch up with you.
What'd they look like?
Oh yeah?
You like people?
Good luck to you.
Okay.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Doing what?
Can I be honest?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Why not?
Somebody else is going to get it.
Don't call me stupid.
I came in the front.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Look at all this junk.
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Don't.
Yes.
That's Montana over there.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Yes.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
Planet 10?
Then what?
You're a welcome sight...
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
So where's Buckaroo?
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Let him go.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
If you could, I'd –
Well I have to come up with – an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
Well... THIS.
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
Barton!
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational–
How long you been up there, Fink?
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
What's that?
I'm a writer. Ted O –
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
Go ahead, son.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
Hold on –
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
What do you think happened?
Jesus, Charlie, I...
It's okay... It's okay...
...I just don't know what... to do–
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
I'm sorry if I let you down.
...Okay
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
...Those your only bags?
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
We got a treatment on it yet?
Mr. Lipnik, I –
All night?
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
How is your -- personal life?
How about the booze?
How's not smoking?
Catherine Tramell.
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
What is this interest you've got in her?
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
Sure.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why does he do it?
Why take the risk?
What did you think?
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
How'd you get in here?
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
You have the right to an attorney.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Was she ever a suspect?
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
What you doin', son?
No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
I don't think it's funny.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
Catherine says you don't like her.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
Why not?
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
Where the hell you goin'?
Were you with him last night?
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
Now what?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Fuck you, Phil.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
She's a suspect.
Why do you think he's dead?
Who are you?
When's your show?
What do you think?
New York.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
What's with the wigs?
Is Jean Michel here?
Jean, your parents are here.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Who did this?  Who did this?
MOTHAFUCKAH!
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
What do you mean?
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
What are they?
Paint it out.
Blue? Where?
Who am I?
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
You got a date already?
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
We got beat.
Guess I just got sick of him.
You do! You definitely do.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
It looks done.
Hi.
Don't you think he's using you?
Some of them.
Come on.
You see? You have someone to live for.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
So shut up and keep painting..
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
I guess this mean we won.
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
Well that's a ... long story ...
You almost sound enthusiastic.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
Ten, nine...
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Uncle Alfred?
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Is there something wrong, sir?
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
I love you, old man.
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
Women.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
I'm on break from-
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
We gotta get those locks changed.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
If we could relay the sunlight-
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
No!?
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
Who's Ivy?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
That's gotta hurt.
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
How about dangerous curves?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
Scholarly research?
Actually, he took the car.
There's one other thing. I feel..
...A bat.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Master, Bruce?
May I help you, Master Grayson?
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
He's home. I sent the signal.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
Rinka.
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
Back off, man.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
You can't-.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Edward...
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
How'd you find us?
No.  Wait...
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
A-14.
Where's the boy?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Can't we --
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
... How long have I been out?
What is that?
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
Great.  Give me a grant.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
Do you want a drink?
What did you see?
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Keep her on the line!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
MOVE! Can't you do something??
I missed you, Lieutenant.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
I understand.
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
And what happens if we say no?
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Peanuts?
Not what?
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
And what did you say?
It's the last thing we need.
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
0 my god.
Big day today, huh? 78
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
You're not going to ....
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Welsh again.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Doctor Jacobson?
Interesting suit.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Come on Sting!
What's gone?
This sucks.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
So, like, where is she?
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
Bunghole...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
Does that say Xanax?
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
...Two...
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
She sure does.
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
You scored with two chicks?!
You got two seconds!
She's ready.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
You'd better sit down, hon.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
Here's something.
What happened?
I guess we open it.
She's only fourteen...
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
What time is it?
Nobody else can.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Handbook?  When...?
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
I want to be dead too.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Where is your mother?
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
What's wrong?
Okay?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Are they still here, Otho?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
An attorney?
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
... Do you think we should look for him?
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
... Good night, Chauncey.
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
Do you like it?
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
I feel very good in here.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
... Then you really are a gardener?
Some pictures...?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
Let's have a look, do you mind?
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
... My suitcase.
Does it have a television?
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
... How long have you been living here?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Sid, it's useless!
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Do you feel well enough for that?
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
... How are the kids getting along?
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
I can certainly understand that...
... Yeah...
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
This is not what I requested.
... So what does all that add up to?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
... Well?
Well, Ben... I...
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
I don't know.
Morning.
Is the trial date set?
Why, Craig. why?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
I have to go back now.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
Why aren't you at work?
Why?
So how was it? What was he doing?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
What about Maxine?
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Maxine...
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Pardon?
Mr. Juarez?
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
Who told you?
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're glowing again.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
No.
You can be John Malkovich.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
I'm getting divorced.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
When?
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
She's not available.
Thanks so much for coming over.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
I'd love to see your work.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
You've got to be kidding.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
You still know.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
I want somethin' sweet.
You grown.
What you want?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
What you want'em for?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
Be here. In case.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
MAMA!
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Out where?
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
You shaved.
What, baby?
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Fuck.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Uh-huh.
Jesus fucking Christ.
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
What do you mean, Dude?
Where you going, Dude?
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Kill that poor woman.
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
I've had a--
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Take it easy, Dude.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Which one was Logjammin'?
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Well...yeah--
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
What happened to your house?
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
What's your point, Walter?
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Theodore Herzel.
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Hey man--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
That...fucking...bitch!
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Have it your way.  The point is--
Oh shit.  Walter.
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
...Huh?
Wooden bridge, huh?
What the fuck?
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Who the fuck is that?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh-huh.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
It is a fucking emergency.
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
What's mine is mine.
Well can we--
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
Oh, shit.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
I'm not--
Whatta we do about the Mex?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
Where to first?
What about Nomak?
Recognize him?
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Anyone else make it?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
It means "bloodbrother."
How do you feel?
You came back for me.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
What's your problem, Whistler?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
Put it back in park, Blade.
You got something in mind, Blade?
What's going on?
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
What took you so long?
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
But, he could've --
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
What are you looking at?
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Like what?
Just get out of here.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
Is he sick?
Get out of here --
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
How's it going, Kam?
You don't have to be.
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
How do you like that? Right on time.
You're a monster.
What happened to the power?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
What do you mean?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
Looks like business is booming.
--the witch kills children--
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
Anna--
Baby names?
What can I get you?
Just now?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
Then I'm going--
Beer and weed is what I've got.
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
This is a little nuts.
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
What I never could figure about the movie?
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
English.
Where <u>is</u> it?
Fire escape??
What the fuck--??
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
What're you doing?
What?
Okay, but--
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
Just let it go, I've got you!
Oooh. Oooh.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Women miscarry all the--
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
What're you afraid's going to happen?
--I know!
Okay. Hypothetically.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
What?
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Domini's the only logical explanation.
I should check on Anna.
No. We <u>all</u> go.
What the fuck's going on here?
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Thanks, Meurice.
Abby. What's the matter?
What was that?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
So how long have you know Meurice?
He needs a room, Dusty.
What night is it?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
I told you. I like you.
...You know that car?
...What was that back there?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
What "what"?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
What did you take these for?
...Just doin' my job.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
...There's a big--
...What?
Yeah. Is it...
...What did you do with the bodies?
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
Pour that back.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
That's not the point.
Thanks Meurice.
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
What day is it today, Angie?
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Where are we going, Frank?
Frank?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
That oughta do it.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Yes.
Yes.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Hi. can I come in?
. I. uh.
I liked being with you last night.
Oh shit.
No. I should go.
Do you like my body?
I want you to hurt me.
You like to open me. don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Heineken.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Oh yeah?
How is Central these days?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Now, how are you going to do that?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Are you alright?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
So. what's next?
Here's to. an interesting experience.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Okay. thanks.
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Did you see her undressed?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Okay. okay.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yeah.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
What was that all about?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
You want to dance?
NO.
Probably not. no. Why?
Look Jeffrey.
What time are visiting hours?
I'm going out for awhile.
No.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
No honey, I'm alright.
Nothing like this back home.
Should we buy it?
You wanna split?
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Tuna, this is crap.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Mirtha.
Goodness.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
What do you got there, Diego?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
No, my brother.
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
But you must.  It's the only way.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
Please, continue.
What's the matter, George?
I know.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
George.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
George, good to see you, my brother.
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Well, you know.  It's um...
Surprised to see me?
G-d, son.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
Yeah.  Nice.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
Freedom.
Sure.
Keep them coming.
Money.
Diego?
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
I know.
What are you going to do?
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
How are you doing, George?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Jesus Christ.
Pablo said no?
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
But this is...
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
What are you doing here?
Well, here I am.  See?
What?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Second name.
How much are they paying you?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's good nobody is following us ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
No, and neither were my men.
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Are you ready, colonel?
How you doin' Mister D?
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
An inquiry into what?
I think I'm going to make your day.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
That's what my report will read.
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
What induced it?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Did they argue the day before he died?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Objection sustained.
Why would she want that?
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
She's innocent.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
What about Miss Lawson?
Is it Marsh?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
And how are you now?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
What happened after that?
Yes.
What kind of information?
What did she say?
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
What did you prescribe for her?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
I heard him say it.
No.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
How do you know that?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
I suppose.
Who told you that?
--and that he changed his will?
Yes.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
Hi, Joe.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
Something like that.
Why not?
Why not?
Is it against the law?
Nothing.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Yes -- it would be nice.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
What are you going you doing?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
I'm dropping the case.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
The witness will answer the question.
If you want me to.
Can't it wait?
What's wrong?
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Please -- not now.
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
Are you from Washington originally?
Oh there you are.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Lemon?
Where are you staying while you're here?
And how long are you here for?
About a year and a half.
He's very... clean.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Why, do you think?
Do you miss it?
When?
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Am I interrupting anything?
I would love to come for dinner.
Yeah?
Can I help?
How about if I set the table?
Yes.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Yes.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
You feeling better Franny?
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
I'm positive.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
About an hour ago.
It clearly states in the will --
Hell no!
Died there?  How?
'S up?
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
You want us to move in here?
You soundin' like the old man now.
What else?  Money.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Let me see your hand.
I want you to do something for me, baby.
But.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
What it will be.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Aren't you going to join us?
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Have you ever been inside?
And what's that?
Please.  It's for your own good.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
How do you know?
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
I can't.  Not yet.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I'm here.
Did you do it?
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
Please...help me...
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
You gotta use your imagination.
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
Where is it?
Caesar!
Sit down, Gino!
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, what happened?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
It's impossible!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Got to think this through ...
Violet, please!
You can't leave.
...  maybe three hours.
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
It's not here, Caesar.
Where is the money?
I saved you.
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
How many'd you do?
Now, where the fuck is my money?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
This is a beautiful place.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Curious, maybe.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
No.
No.
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
That's his brother.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Any bodyguards?
Where will you be?
Jesus, that's beautiful.
What if he doesn't run?
Hey.
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
I know you will.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
I won't ask again.
Paris.  I live in Paris...
Treadstone.
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
So now you know.
I don't think so.
Who do you think sent me?
Sir, you waited on line.
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
I need a ride out of here.
I've got a situation here and --
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
What does that mean?
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
Okay, so you're a victim.
I needed a break.
Where?
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
-- just --
I trusted you.
Oh, Jesus...
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
And that's it?
Yes.
He run away often?
Get in the basement.
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
Tell him we're busy.
-- what're you talking about? --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Er ... Thanks ...
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
If I can help you ...
Gillian Layton?
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Hello, Jack!
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
How much do you know?
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
What's she done?
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Out of kindness.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Jack?... Jack?
You think these are tits don't you?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Don't litter my cab!
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Why not?
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
What's going on here?
It's heavy.
Who is this war against, Sam?
They'll be there waiting.
Security.
We? Don't blame me!
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Oh my God, a mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Try next of kin.
Here. What do I do next?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Damn! Blast!
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
How long will she he away?
Mother? Is that you?
Sam!!! 
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
Er, don't you want to search me?
But I could be anybody.
what? ... Oh ... 
Ha!!
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Where is she?
So, Frank, am I going to live?
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Okay, what happened?
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
Sure, sure, give go.
Is there any chance?
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
Did you see my father?
Yes?
Sleeping.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
I think I'd remember that.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
Don't seem so bad to me.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
I hate vodka.
The family know?
No.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Don't push it, Larry.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
Shit, shit, shit...
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
Yes.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
Wait.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
You packing up tonight?
London.
Hi.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Eventually rising to...
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
He must have been great-looking, right?
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
I'd give anything if that were true.
I write for you sometimes.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
How'd it go?
Do you feel good about it?
Aaron, will you tell me?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
What?
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Don't say anything about anything.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Let's go...
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
The cost-efficient reporter.
We came from Washington.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Jane?
It's Aaron.
Yes.  How do you know?
I wish it were you giving the story.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
I had no idea she was this good.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
No.  Were you going to you?
So what did you think?
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
That's not it.
No.  Did he really?
Why?
I got promoted for things like that.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
I knew what you meant.
Take it easy.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Are you okay?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
More champagne, your majesty?
It's true, isn't it?
Nice night out...
Of course I do!
I like you very much, Walter.
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Are you alright?
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
Man look at that get up !
Man this is heavy!
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
People seem to like my cat.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
You didn't mean to what?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
I- don't know what you're talking about!
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
You're gonna shoot me!
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
I saw your...cat.
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Hello Mayolia.
Well, I'll go home with you.
You don't have to do anything!
Good night Walter...
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
What's wrong with you!?!
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
No, we didn't.
It's coffee.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
I... feel.... pretty.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Did you see a girl come by here?
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Hi, Buffy.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
Buffy, what are you doing here?
You left me a message?
I am a God!  A God!
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
How are you doing?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
They were vampires, weren't they?
Well, stay here tonight.
Hey, Buffy...
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
Come again?
Like what?
What are we doing?
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
You were supposed to be here at three.
You look way pretty, Kim.
What are you talking about?
Why?
I was a slave.
How do you know all this?
Meet me at this address after school.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Not a pressing issue.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
Interesting.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
No THX.
That is so cool.
Pike.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
I can't believe they still ate it.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
What happened?
Smell of booze much.
And the January Semi-formal --
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
You said "Crash".
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
How ya like that?
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
Fundamentals?
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
You should be at the game.
I'm Crash Davis.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Damn.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Why not?
Annie---
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Ninety-three miles an hour.
He's a good student.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
I got him on the knee!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
I didn't spit on you!
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm going to the Show.
You're a great catcher.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Sorry about last night.
Nuke--  Good luck.
Step outside, pal.
I'd kill ya.
She's playing with my mind.
I gotta go now, Dad.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
Where's Ebby?
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
What'you want, kid?
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
Thank you.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
A powerful man.
He even played golf with the President.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
...stupid things.
Oh, good.
Hey!
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
When did this happen, honey?
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
All right, Ace?
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
No, no it's okay.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
All right.
Yeah.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
That's right, yeah.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
What - what, Caesar's?
...hundred yards further down the road.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
You go and put your things away.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
Well, sir, I was just...
...position...
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
To Abraham Lincoln.
Sam, we got a problem.
Okay, thank you for asking.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
You all right?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You sure?
Hi. Nice to see you.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
Oscar wants you to call him.
With Jennifer.
To the Riviera.
Why do you want to do that?
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Hi, Sam.
Fuck you.
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
Loose machines are right back over there.
Okay, I'll -
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
Excuse me.
I just wanna get out of here.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Yeah.
I don't want to go to Europe.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Yes.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Fucker!
You just - Just stop him.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Leave me alone!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
Hey, Frankie.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Sure.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Thank you.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Yeah.
Let me think about that.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Hm.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Yeah.
Nicky, please...
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Great.
Come on.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
All right.
I'm here.
I'm always here for you.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
We'll go later.
He was just on the phone.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
Yes, don't worry.
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Wow.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
You must have drunk too much.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Don't know.
Whoa. Calm down.
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Since when do you talk like that?
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
The crowd bought it.
Works for me.
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
Are you sure?
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
I've been looking for you.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
God-damn..
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
I loved you.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
You think so?...Selina?
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
I don't know what came over me.
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Like you don't know...
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
You seem sad, Spooky.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
What was that for?
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Lady, don't let him do it!
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
You never miss a trick.
That's your "rep."
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
If you know that just back off.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Lose the hardware now.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
Oh won't I?
Don't lay this on me!
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Please.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Hey drop it, okay?
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
What bank?
Not a chance.
What's going on?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Why tell me this?
Yes?  Yes?
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
God, if he doesn't come back --
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Damned if I know.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
What's that supposed to me?
He wants 75 back.
They did some great job of reforming you.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
That's a reasonable possibility.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
I don't know what you mean.
You should've done all this before.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
Yeah?
Who's this?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
I can see the benefit in that.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
See that, Col?
Good thing in a man.
You see that, Col?
Don't be like that --
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
Fuck off back to Essex!
Do you mean that?
What's that supposed to mean?
Someone recommend you?
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
What was that all about?
He's getting up.
You want me to ask you in, right?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Piss off, Dave!
As different as it's possible to be.
No --
You want to know how I kissed him?
What would he think?
I think you do.
Did he come here too?
Maybe.
What does that mean?
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
You could?
Sure I do.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Do they know?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Am I becoming repetitious?
You want another haircut, baby?
Why?
So it's true, then?
You like me better like this.
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Come on...
So tell me.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
Your soldier.
Died...
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Love me.
Tell me you love me.
Then say it.
You do?
And you'll never leave me?
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Yes.
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
See does he want some.
Hey -- what's he like?
Have a look at him.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Dil!
Back in a minute, Jody
You OK about that?
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
What?
Why do you want to do that for?
I thought it was Dave.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Thank God for that.
Hope not.
I seen your fucking face.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Why can't we?
What do you know about my nature?
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Didn't look like that to me...
C'mere.
No?
She your wife?
So what were you fucking around for, then?
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Never.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Who's Dil?
Do you?
We don't look on it like that.
I didn't.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Go to sleep now.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Faster than cricket?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
It was fun while it lasted.
All right -- where's the letter?
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
I could eat a horse.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
What?
Oh, you should see your face.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
When you come on, you really come on.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Lord, you're stubborn.
Yes, you told me.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Reggie -- please believe me!
Reggie -- listen to me!
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
I believe you.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Oh.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Yes -- ?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Are you sure there's no mistake?
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Around one.
Bartholomew?
What's your first name today?
But you're -- divorced?
Oh.
You'd lie about anything.
What now?
Sorry about that.
Keep going.
Very pretty. Now what?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Why you lied to me.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Your --
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Sure.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Said what?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Or Tex?
Hm?
Reggie -- open the door.
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
No -- not yet.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Why don't you shut up!
Forty-five thousand.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Where did he keep his money?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Voilà what?
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
But he is gone.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Please, not on my account.
What was all that?
Who said?
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Go on.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
So they think he left it with you.
Who is it?
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
But why do you want a divorce?
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Who is it from?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Hi Jody.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
A little.
Ok.
No honey.
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
Should we close down any eruption?
What happened?
Well?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Really?
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Pay no attention to me.
You gave me a 'D'.
Me? Why me?
_ Your father raped someone?
Yes.
You're the killed.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Not that many.
You ok?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I heard you got attacked.
They're not picking me up until six.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
Jody. Wait.
Thanks for coming back for me.
Hi mom.
What?
Where are you going?
Wait.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
What?
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
I said no.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
That wasn't me ...
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
It's a damn postal truck!
Where's Sam?
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
I got, uh....
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog ain't mean.
...-ed.
No cell.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
...fine.
Ah, one of them's in the back.
 Nice job back there.
...I'm not the psycho.
...let live.

Come on, old...
...Shift.
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!

Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...wanna give it a try!
...Pete.  Come on.
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!

No.  Shit.
All right.


Oh, shit!

This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Listen, Arlo...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...

Yeah.

Arlo, shut up.
Yeah.

 All right.  Okay.
Come here.
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
...to him. 
We!
Here...
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Mason.

Come on.  Come on.
What?
...-ta get outta here!
Hang on, hang on.

Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
You did help a little.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who put the big hurt on...
 Yeah.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
I was undercover as a tennis player.
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
I urge you to be persuasive.
Vaughn.

It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
...here.   Mason... 
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Whoo-hoo! 
Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
They were all wearing hardware.
And I changed the schedule.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
"I am become Death, the...


No, go--
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
"Went away."  I like that.

I can't say it's a surprise.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.
 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
There.
This was supposed to be a...
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Right.  Tim Mason.
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
I beg your pardon?
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Not tonight...
I want you to look at one another...
...the river.
...and unharmed, de-...



Dead, last time I...



Yeah?
...somehow. 
Geneva just pulled the plug.
...tight!
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
It's not over, Brynner.
Thanks. 
And where are you going?
...-time. 
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...back...

If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Lying? 
...public drunkenness....
...stole a truck under arrest.
Don't move!
Okay, doc.

Do it now.
...gotta seal it.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
None.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
At my age, you tend to lose track...
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
Haven't the faintest idea.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
You've got her? Where?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
They don't kill a guy for that.
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
I'll throw that in too.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
That's a filthy habit.
Yes.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Looking for someone.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
I'd like to talk to him.
I don't want it anymore.
No. It was an accident.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
What are you doing here?
Isn't that your number?
I want the rest of the pictures.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
What are you talking about?
It's too late.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
What's the maid's address?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
Would you like something to drink?
That's not his apartment.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
No. I went riding rather early.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
My husband.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Mr. Gittes.
I mean I can't tell you.
How did it happen?
Another satisfied client?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Then it was over the water department.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Know him?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
Working for the District Attorney.
What's wrong?
I saw him.
Okay, give me the keys.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
I'll take care of it.
...where does Kyo live?
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
The obituary column?
Yeah, Sophie.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
I'm sorry. We don't.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Do you know me?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Gittes?... Gittes?
Yeah?... I do?
Of course not.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Then go home and forget about it.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
How did they get it away from him?
This?
Apple core?
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
Not exactly.
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
Course, she settled down nicely.
That's for sure.
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
You weren't expecting me?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
Father, I have sinned...
But...who...
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
Elena!...But when...
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
Then where's the money?
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane -
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Sure, sure.
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Do you, Mr. Leland?
What's happened?
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
Is it good?
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
I know that, Emily -
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
Ow!
Oh!
A rooster?
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I won't let you go.
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
Get Dr. Corey.
Raymond - 
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Tired?
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
I mean I've got a job for you.
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Yes?
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Hello, Brad.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Maybe you could remember something that -
What's this?
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
I know, but -
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
Who told you you could sit down here?
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
Hey, now wait a sec...
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
She said not to come home until graduation.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
You're kidding.
Such a sordid state of affair.
Why?
It's not what you think.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
No.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
Sang.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
That's easy to say from over here.
Are you open?
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
Cute cat. What's his name.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
Seven months.
Allan Harris.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
I guess.
Yeah.
It would stand to reason, yes.
More or less.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Nudie booth?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Are you gonna lock the store?
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Why not?
Shit. What about tomorrow?
Oh, my god.
No!
I can't fucking believe you!!
Let me borrow your car.
What the fuck did you do that for?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
You're happy?
Now I know you're lying.
Hey, what about Veronica?
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Around three or something.
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
You should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
How's your eye?
You didn't have to choke me.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Like ten after.
To talk to you.
To say the least.
Just the paper.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
I am not.
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
What were you doing up so late?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
Typically male point of view.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
How flattering.
Oh, you think so?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Where?
He requested this?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Well...?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
A few?
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
What are you talking about?
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
What did he say?
Really?
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
I'm not sad.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Like hell you are!
Willam!
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
Where are you, Walker?
The money!
I'm coming out!
What the hell are you doing here?!
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
There you go.
Four...five...
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
He knows it well.
The winds are picking up.
Hello, Gabriel.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
Where?
And I can't leave.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
What if he can't?
Gabe!?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Gabe!
Reach up!  Do it!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
He'll freeze.
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
You said there was a way across.
He never hurt anybody.
Yeah...
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Don't use my name!
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
Been punished, yeah?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Great, sir. Great.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
So this is the young man?
Hullo.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
It's alright, thank you.
I beg your pardon?
Do you feel that way now?
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Good.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
What job and how much?
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
I'm gonna be sick.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Yes sir.
No, sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Brown hair, is it?
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
You've heard Beethoven before?
How are you feeling today?
Just part of hospital routine.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
How many did I get right?
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
What's all this about sin?
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Max, the cab driver!
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
A deer?
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
You know Dmitri?
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
You guys been holding hands?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
You're gonna cheer up.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
Yeah?  So?
...why is everything always about you...
Hello?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Like what?
Got it?
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
What are you doing?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
I don't know any Rwandans.
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Vincent?
Let him go, Vincent.
What you mean, no?
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
You go every night?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
The man who hired me for this contract.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
In case he asks.
You get benefits?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
Who's Heller?
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Slow the hell down!
Max?
They said send you downstairs.
That's love.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
I never told her.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Saved you last night's, too.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
You think I'm crazy.
I better get going.
Just relax.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Equitation.
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Shoot.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Murdered?
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
Now what?
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Without a song in my heart.
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
I love you, too.
I'm a very patient man.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
You made your decision yet?
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Can I ask you something?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
I want to believe you, too.
What gave me away?
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
There's no plug to pull.
What in the hell...?
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
David --
What does it say?
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Talk to him.
Why did you contact us?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Am I one... or many?
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
What kind of deal?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
What's that?
Hokkaido Island.
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
But what about your research -- ?
But the work --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Spoken like a true believer.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Do you love your parents?
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
What...?
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
But --
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
What went wrong?
No.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Lookit her bounce.
Gotta have kings.
Go hard!
We saw the broads.
Please! Please!
You got your mind right, Luke?
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
So then you just call him.
Lemme see it!
Oh lookit that brunette.
A cold drink.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
Where'd the road go?
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
But, Luke...
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Man, it's so hot.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
One, two, three... 
You ain't man enough to wear them!
I hate this...
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
You're fired.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
He was lying.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
I was?  How you spell that?
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Ah ha.  What did he want?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Is it an ongoing case?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
We'll show that to...
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
But it's a different m.o.
What's that siren?
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
I don't want this.  What are they?
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
Yes.
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Just get out of your vehicle...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
I was.
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
Absolutely.
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
Sergeant?
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Where were you?
Did you come?
Where's the car?
What!? They brought the car here?
Have you seen it?
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
Do you find him attractive?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
So - why the airport?
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Crash victim?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
What kind of place is this?
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Yeah, everything's under control.
Hi, Mom.
Fuck me.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
Tell us every detail.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Yes.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Yeah?
You can only do what feels best to you now.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
He asked me to marry him.
Guess which hand.
For a price.
No.
We'll get caught.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
Shocking, huh?
I wish I could have seen that.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
Then it's over.
Where to?
Good luck.
Promise?
I think I should go home.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
What do you mean not taking your meds?
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
What are we going to do?
I love you so much.
Can I put these here for tonight?
Yeah?
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
What?
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Hey man, you can't do that!
Where's your brother?
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
-- Super what?
Okay.   How much?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
They're gonna be what?
But you were there?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
I only have your word for that.
I don't know.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Because you're the closest.
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
Hopefully no one.
He said to go fuck yourself.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Turn on the flashlight.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
That moron.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
All right, knock it off.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
What?
Guns.   Can you get them?
I've got a way with people.
Yeah?
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
Hey boss, it's not a science.
Everything.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
The map said to go left.
What do we do?
Yes.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
How's my brother?
What happened?
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Mr. Zammito?
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
No shit?
How are we going to do that?
You're not helping.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
Who's gonna see it there?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
What's this?
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Go ahead.
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Put them down.
Do you know her?
This spells trouble.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
I've missed you.
Please.
Here you must be in proper attire.
You, sister...
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Let's end this here.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
You were enlightened?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Save your strength.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
No onions though, okay?
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Do you feel okay.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Miss her?
Get it?
That thing is poisonous.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
I have his journal.
Nothing.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Romantic? He rapes her.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
I sincerely doubt it.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
It was fine.
And that's a bad thing?
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
No, not at all.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Somerset Maugham.
Need any company?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Am I bothering you?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
You really want to know?
I just came to say goodbye.
Good for you.
Would you like a tour?
This isn't working out for me anymore.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
But you knew this was important to me.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Ben Schwarz.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Where did you find those?
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
Are you for real?
See that wasn't so bad.
If that's what you call it.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Excellent.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
And then I can go home?
What are you doing?
You think?
Need any company?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Yes!
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
What are the terms?
Fuck her yet?
Call me later.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Who are you spying on?
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Tell me all the details.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
It clearly is why.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
To my triumph, of course.
Get off me!
Get out? We had an arrangement.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
Not at all. What's wrong?
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Ronald? That's crazy.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
She's out.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
What time is it?
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
Ronald, I'm sorry.
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
Oh, hello.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
What are saying, darling?
Mommy --
But where did you get it, Amy?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Where'd you get this, darling?
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
I know that.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Ollie.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Where did you get it?
What's funny?
Where did you mail them?
Certain wishes do.
And who did the voice belong to?
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Just you wait!
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
Irena. But who are you?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Merry Christmas.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
You mustn't be afraid.
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
A lady threw it to me.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
But I only came to give back the ring.
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
What is it, ma'am?
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
Or if there's a full moon.
Where are all the mediums?
I think she broke the skin.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Hey, did you get contacts?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
At least your PMS is over.
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
What did he say?
Hello?
Oh no.
What happened to his tooth?
DON'T call the police.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
Fall in love.
I think George knows.
I do development for TV movies.
You hungry?
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
I'm really tired.
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Mark.
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
No.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
It's stupid.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
What's wrong?
Everything okay?
You had a date with Carlton?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Is it that funny?
You didn't say it.
What's with the squirt guns?
You know, I've never seen your cat.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
I'm going to take a shower.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
We can get a warrant if you like.
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
It's for you. Frida.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
He was found a few blocks away.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Sell maps?
What's he doing here?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
His wife.
They don't speak English...
Doctor!  What brings you here?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
What is this place?
Good evening, sir.
Lost something?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Iím your new assistant.
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
I don't know who they are.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
Such a joker!  Like your father.
I see.  The verdict, yes...
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
Can I get my life back?
First Lady...
Mr. President...
What the hell is this?
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
.. Nothing.
Fine?
Don't call the Vice President!
Just don't call him, Alan!
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Clean.
It's a homeless shelter.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Three years.
I'll lock him away for good.
Are you threatening me?
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
No.
In the car.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
We've got to fix this.
`Dave'?
Yes, Mr. President?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
What are they?
The Fidelity nonsense...
Oh... Hi.
Yeah.
I was waiting for that jack.
Well...
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
What?
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
That's a secret.
Yes.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
It was okay?
What?
You really believe that?
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
What?
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
Where are you going, Tyler?
Step up here, Tyler.
It's been fired.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
I here and now commit myself to daring!
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yeah?  Like what?
Yes sir.
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Don't stop.
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Who else was involved in this?
Hey, he's your roommate.
You what?!  How did you do that?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
This is stupid.
You fucked up little prick!
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Very good, Mr._?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
Again!  Louder!
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Too bad.
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Where are you going?
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
What?
I've found it.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Come on, that's impossible.
But if he said no before then...
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Neil, you're not gonna...
Oh..
You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
They are...they are everywhere.
Who?
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
And no questions asked.
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Self sufficient...
Like cattle...
What is it?
Finnegan...
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
...Jagger was here...I was here...
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Or maybe not.
Why don't you back off?
What was that?
Fucking women, man...
Fuel up. Need fuel.
That's mustard!
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
I'll get the boots.
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
I'm telling you, they changed it!
What the --!
Tell him, Vince!
Let's go!!!
You don't!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
I have to go.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
You mean...?
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Hey, guys...
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Okay.
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
How are you?
Frost.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
That way it sets.
You think about it?
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
We gotta play with more bullets.
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
No. No way!
Here, here! This is it!
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Great. That's great.
See you Monday.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Did you go hunting.
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
He's getting married... and we're nuts!
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
Up I would say... What would you say?
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Funny guy.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Mug sheets.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
Hello Wade.
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
Sir, your limo's here.
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
Hey, buddy...
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Why?
You want to be a good detective?
Wanna try?
Sanchez...?
You treat her nice.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
I just heard.
No.  I want to be with you.
You should be in hospital.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
Yes.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
I'll take it.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Who are these people?
Belle --
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Howdy, Jabez.
Say ... about the interest ...
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Never mind. What's your name?
-- in gold.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
What's the matter with you?
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
Well -- what are we going to do?
Mary -- it's gone.
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
We must go on home, Jabez.
Mary --
I'm serious.
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Do you really think that?
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
What's that you say, Son?
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
I wanted to give it all to the church.
I want someone to talk to ...
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
I'm John McClane.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
You're all right, Argyle.
You're very perceptive.
Nothing...
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
The code key, please...?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
You...you're an American?
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Yo!
What are you doing?
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
Roy?  You still with us?
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
Jesus, you're the man!
Aw, hey...
You'll be okay.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
What guns?
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
I don't know what I'm doing.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
That's it.
I know!
Denmark?  Sweden?
It's my only chance!
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
Who's this?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
What the hell you doin' back there?
What the fuck do you want?
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Well, what were you doin' back there?
Don't fuck with me ...
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Yeah?
I want to talk to him.
Okay, is the vault open?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
You like me?
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
I didn't eat any pizza.
How did you know your son was involved?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
Because I don't want cancer.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
He's gone?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
We won't have to.
To show that we're negotiating.
Sonny -
What'd he say?
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
Oh my God, mother!
We can't stay here.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
Of course not ...
And if you can't deliver them?
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
So what?
Yes.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
Not really.
Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>
We're covered on legal with that, right?
Fast and or furious.
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
You were good.
<i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i>
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
So?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
Make it plain.
Good morning.
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
How many you say?
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
It's a fucking shame.
Sweet Dick Willie.
It's dug.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
We both do.
No.  What are you gonna do?
Mookie?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
You a blue-moon fool.
What else?
Later for you.
Where are you going?
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
Smack him back.
Yeah.
I know this.
I'm listening.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Turn it off.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
I didn't think so.
The both of youse, shaddup.
Pop asked you.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Oh my god, are you alright?
But I came here to learn about America.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Would you like something to drink?
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Just down the hall.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
You take that back!
HARRY.
Can he do that?
Owww... refreshing.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
According to the map, we're just about at school.
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
I kinda screwed things up.
HARRY! I found the treasure!
It's okay. I want the rush.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
She's one of a kind.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
I thought I told you to get lost.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
TURK, leave him alone.
TURK, what are you doing here?
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Why ith dat newth?
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
I'm so close I can feel it.
That's it. I'm done.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Do I know you?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Okay.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
What?
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
I think you did it.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
Knock knock.
It's a surprise.
Oh, just like the President.
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
Yes?
We have just folded space from Ix...
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
I can assure you...
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Things have been so serious here lately.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
Do you know this my lady?
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
Don't touch my mother...
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
Liet?
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
THE PAIN!
Did they try and fail?
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
What is this place?
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
Last night was quite a romp.
Jesus!  Are you serious?
I don't understand.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
It's a damn good role.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
Goddamn landlord.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
I kinda need it now.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Mr. Wood?!
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Is there a script?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
Oh, it's you again.
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
Stop!
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
You're <u>sure</u>???
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
How's your mother?
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
What?!
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
How you doing, Ed?
Yeah?
They tore her dress! ...
I don't think so.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
Send him away.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
How's Marcia? She all right?
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
Yes.
He had girlfriends!
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
She won't.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Hey, Lou.
You do though, you look great.
Ha!
Really?
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I wish my stepfather was here.
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
This is going right up your ass.
I'm making a tape.
I got your message. Way to go!
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Marcia's living with a singer?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
You brought the girl!
Good-bye, brother!
You don't recognize me.
No. Two times.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Sign here, please.
By the X.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Tu
In love?
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
Mr. M.?
Larry?
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
Tracy.
Here they are.
NO, that's fine
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Hello, Mr. M.
I hope so
What is it. Tammy?
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
What do you want, Jim?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
And she's super-nice
These are private -- these are for us.
I mean at you.
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Hell, good luck!
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
That obvious, huh?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
Did you talk to Exley?
Captain, what do you want?
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
Will you work for me?
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
What's through here?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
What?
You expecting problems?
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
Ellis Loew.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
No.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Ed, I want confessions.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
You're the key witness?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
Glasses.
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
I'm curious about you.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
A sweet man.
Not a word.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Pacific Coast Bell.
Have we met before?
I just gave him my card.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Yes.
What <u>is</u> that?
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
I'll pay you.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
Jesus!
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
They're here.
Gimme that.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
He came in four minutes ago.
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
That's fine.
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
What size?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Your stuff?
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Anything at all?
Was he with anyone?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
Are you sure you're safe?
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Why the hell would I--
That ain't me.
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
Do you like fish?
Brill?
I know.
That's temporary.
Rachel--
I'm gonna fix it.
You're a moron, you know that?
Yeah?
He didn't.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Hey!
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Bobby--
I don't under--
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
She can't talk to you right now.
Some of 'em.
It's okay to use the phone.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
Yes.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
They're framing me.
No, I--
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Yeah.
Well we'd sure like to help you.
Yes. But we can't.
What's your opinion?
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
What?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
What about the tapes?
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
What about--
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Now is that clear?
Thank you.
How much did you pay?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
You sing.  All the time.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Do they know them?
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
This is - what is this?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Why did he bring you?
I'm sorry, Katharine.
Very well.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
David Caravaggio.
Is this you?
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Or was it Toronto?
Yeah, for a while.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Oh, all over.
Thought you'd never wake up!
Irving Berlin.
Top Hat.
Hana tells me you're leaving.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Right.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Why would anyone do this?
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
What are you up to?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
It's what I've learned.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
Why Picton?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
I'll come with you.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
Mac's signature.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Gin? Where the hell are you?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I can't?
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
I don't want to waste your time.
Are you...okay?
Do you mind?
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
Oh?
Maybe I should drive this time.
Very nice.
It's a fake.
But--
Those are my clothes.
You stole my luggage? You--
Lose something?
I know it well.
Only a week?
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
Someone was expecting that.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Got it.
You bought this for me?
Aren't we early?
You're nervous again.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
We're working.
You can't be too careful.
We did it.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
You've got everything planned.
The Mask. Where is it?
What about the rules?
Well...What are we doing?
You can't be serious.
How do I look?
That was a lifetime ago.
But would you--would you--
That's because you grew up rich.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
Always in a rush.
In the van.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
Oh, it is.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
My friend, you always surprise me.
See you.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
Tony Marvin.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
Fax these to this number, okay?
Jesus.
Hi.  Donna Irving?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
This is a real nice place you got here.
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
What's chromium?
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
You're a girl.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
What medical records?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
This is the only thing you found?
And you can't?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
Is that what I think it is?
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
Someone's following me.
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
I'll see what I can do.
Whoa.  No shit.
So what are you thinking?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
Counts?
And if you had to guess ...
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
I did.  Both.
I wasn't gonna --
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
What is that?
When'd they file the demur?
How many counts?
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
You come to the right place.
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Yeah.  A real moron.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Randy's mom said yes right away.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
No.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
That's Ed.
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
And I miss you.
Think you could learn?
What time is it?
No, I need my car --
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Dr. Paulsen?
Yes, My Lord.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
I can't ...
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Yeah ...
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
Mine, mine.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
Our destruction?  Who?
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
That's right.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Sir, I was wondering ...
I think we're in trouble.
What are you so grouchy about?
We?
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
That depends.  Where are we?
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
I don't like this.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
About what?
This ought to be good.
It's a lovely outpost.
What'd you say?
Someone's falling.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
Closer?!
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
My mind fills with so many images.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
The Hoth System?
Yes, My Lord.
It won't get through the blockade.
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
Do you have a name?
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
With food?
Go easy, Stevie.
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Oh Cuervo...
All right, so I made another deal.
I'm already dead.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
Not you?
Locked.
Got a smoke?
Getting ready to invade.
Later.
Aw, come on, Snake.
What're you doing in here?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
What are they?
No screamin' shit.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
The freeway.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
How? Where?
A king must marry, after all.
Guenevere...
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
Why?
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
They do.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
Now you must pay me.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
What honey?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
No, he's working on another book.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
And you got an invitation.
Dinner at the White House.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
What did the doctor say?
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
May I ask...?
Would you like some more coffee?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Oh, she'd love it.
Good morning Madame.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
A stimulant.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Did he tell you about my party?
About my daughter?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
You wouldn't.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I didn't get you?
To begin with it could make things worse.
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Wanna drink.
Is she gonna die?
Well, not while we're in Washington.
We'll see when we get home okay.
Yeah
Mr. Dennings?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
People get tired.
Oh my God!
I don't want it.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Another one. Had your lunch?
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
Did you do that?
You speak Latin?
Quod nomen mihi est?
I'm all right.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Save your servant
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Amen.
Shut up!!
Why this girl it makes no sense?
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Really?
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Are you comfortable Regan?
Is it Captain Howdy?
I'm afraid.
Yeah, come on in.
Twelve years.
Trunks?
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Honey ...
Beasley.
They gotta go.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Piano.
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Oh no!
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
Jack.
What's wrong with it?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Seeing anyone in particular?
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
Frank?
Jack.
Nice, huh?
A gust of wind killed him.
That's what we agreed.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
Jack.
Get out of here.
I thought we had separate rooms.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
All night?
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
How's it coming?
How long you been at it?
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
The Royal.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
What do you mean?
Be reasonable, Jack.
Cancel, Frank.
Nothing. We get nothing.
What's it for?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What?
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
How're your hands?
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
What do you mean?
How should I take it?
So run a little longer.
What-?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Where's your dress?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
That!  You can't wear that!
It's orange!
Nine.
Nine!
Shoes?
Right.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
Hey, will you look at that?
What's with you guys?
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Whatcha doin' over there?
Brought it.
No.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
Right.  Bring him back.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
And you don't?
You never sang before?
Fucking.
Forget it.
How do you do it? Every night?
You're upset.
Nina?
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
You can always get another girl.
Yeah.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
How'd the show go?
From Hurley's?
Jack.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
John.  It's good to see you.
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
I'm late for surgery.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
No.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Who is this?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
I took it from my fake husband.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
What do you mean?
Go on.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
What are you going to do!
They're too tight.
You always call me Miss Brewster.
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
What's that?
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
-- Yes.
I'm going to the powder room.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Kate Reynolds...
Hello?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
And I know people.
...that’s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
They did a pretty good job.
Do you like kids?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
Hey Jack, you’re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Where’s my car?!  Where’s my Ferrari!?
Like I said, it's a business deal...
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You’re making a business deal...
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
That’s it?  That’s all I get?!  A glare?!
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Finger food...?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Kate’s on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
I can't seem to let go of you...
Are you okay?
What are you doing?
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Thanks, Jack...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
How can you do that?
Look, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I was such a saint before and I’m such a prick now.  Maybe I’m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
C’mon.
Now I’m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
I think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It’s very human.
You’re so...beautiful...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
Are you out of your mind?
You’re moving...
Please. Let’s just go have a cup of coffee. That’s all I’m asking for. I’m sure there’s another flight to Paris tonight.
Mrs. Peterson.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Peter Lassiter...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
I want to see you again.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Don't you have anywhere to go?
That’s totally see through...
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
We had a tough year.
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
About me?  How sweet.
Ben, come in.
He didn't.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
You're hot!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Me like-y.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Apparently I can disappear.
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
What are you doing --
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
How's the IPO?
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Front page?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
What?
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
There were a lot of variables to consider --
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
'Scuse me.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Where do we stand?
Okay to proceed.
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
What is it?
What're you getting at?
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
How bad off is he?
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Wish I knew why.
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
What is it?  Anything wrong?
He's making a fine recovery.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Then how come it worked loose?
You must carry spare parts --
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
I've done all I could with the laser.
What's that?
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
Doctor, we've just about had it.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
There it is!
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
Any reserve air?
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
What is it, Skipper?
How's it look?
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Drop that fucking money!
...Is this a fucking joke?
This is a new car, then, sir?
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
Well, okay, it's -
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
Three people. In Brainerd.
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Yah.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
You're not a C student.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Yah, pretty good.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
Stan and I're okay.
We're good to loan in.
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah.
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
Yah?
...Geez.
Yah, that's a good one.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
I'll fix ya some eggs.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
...Chief Gunderson?
Hon?
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
I love you, Margie.
And his wife?
Oh, my.
This is do-able.
That wouldn't interest you.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
Is that your blood?
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
This could go on for hours.
I don't know ...
No, thanks.
You feel nothing?
Uh ... nah.
You... don't have to... leave.
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
Guy or girl?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Is that what you're calling it?
Say my name.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
Marla...
Why are you doing this?
What happened... ?
Tyler?
... and you come home to this.
You were in here last Thursday night.
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
It's getting exciting now.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
I don't... think so.
I don't follow...
What?
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
I don't know about this.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
How do you feel?
Same here.
What are you reading?
Alive or dead?
You?
Huh?
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
We don't need him...
What... ?
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
What are you talking about?
This conversation...
"Too young?"
"Applicant?"
Why do people think anything?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
...to let this happen!
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
I'm pulling the green wire.
Yes...
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Ask me nicely.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Please...
Damn it!  God-damn it...
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
I'm doing this for us.
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Robert Paulson?
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
I... I don't know...
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
What list?
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
What do you want me to do?
What did you see?
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
You mean Alex Browning.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
This is cheery.
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
Whoa, nine months?
Shouldn't we pull over?
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
"It?"
This place?!
That... him?
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Carter, get out!
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
Cuticle lacerations.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
I'm sorry we broke in.
Knock it off!
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
That's what I'm here for.
I've seen worse places.
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
How you doing, Brewer?
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
Are they going to torture us?
You're gonna love it.
Why's that?
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
That's an order.
You pathetic scum.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
How long have you been setting up?
Who're you?
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
My parents were divorced.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Fine.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Yep! Right on it!
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
I'm sorry.
Can I have my desk please.
What do you think?
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
What if I was a relative?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Where you comin' from?!
Can I help you?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Your name was picked.
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
Oh, Lydia!
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Please don't hurt me?
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Have I died?
Where am I?
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
... Do you know who I am?
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Parry.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
What's her name?
It's such a great song.
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
You a fag too?
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
How do you know him?
Don't say that.
What are we about to do?
I don't drink coffee...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Well, id'n that nice.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Cerveza.
Is it my turn again?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Sure you don't want anything?
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
Well...
Can I get you anything else?
No substitutions.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
No.
Robert...
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Yeah... I guess so...
Maybe you better stay, then.
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
Like what?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
With applesauce?
It's none of your business!
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
Catherine...
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
That'll make you happy.
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
That's three games to none, Carl.
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
If you want to call it that.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
Remember me, from the pool?
What are you doin' here?
That's it?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Come down!
What are you going that way for?
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
How does he look up close?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Where you know Amanda from?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
Would you like me to change anything?
Fletch F. Fletch
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
What the hell are you doing here?
So where do you know Alan from?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
No idea at all?
I think I’d rather have drugs.
You gonna nail the chief?
You're in the Records Room.
And what was that?
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Ten days ago?
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
I'm the Sufi.
Why don't you try suicide?
I'm still here.
Will you kill me?
Did you hear something?
Thanks.
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
His bride. Cute as a button.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
I bet you do.
What's he doing in Utah?
Hi.
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
Why'd you let me in?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Thanks for the great time.
What are you talking about?
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
You want I set up?
No wonder.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
How could you call him?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Now that we've broken the ice...
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
That was close...
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Thanks for the promotion, man.
All your friends call you Jazz.
You wish.
I do it for love.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Ah, an obvious choice.
Hello, Ford...
Aha, just what I suspected!
What an interface!
You okay?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
This way...
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Gut feeling.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
I'm sorry...
It's me.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
What are you running from?
Two words.  Disco Express.
'Booty Time.'
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
What about Don?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
This isn't music!
How nice.
So...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
What?
Got a wife named Angie.
Who knows?
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
Did you pick up the car?
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
We must follow it.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Toy wit' this will ya.
Why not?
What about Sal?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
They around?
You're shitting me!
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
You okay, man?
Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?
Where's Johnny?
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
About what?
Okay, start pedaling.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
You sound...ground up...?
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
It's really you, isn't it?
No wait, don't go!
But that's tomorrow.
Dad, you there?  You okay?
When?
What are you talking about?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
I'll be damned.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
John, you still there?
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
What?
I got it.
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
How you feeling?
John.  John, you all right?
I better give you my address then.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
What?
Got a minute?
He ain't our guy, John.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
So how'd you like LION KING?
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Sullivan?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
Who brought up this bright idea?
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
What're you doin'?
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
What do you mean?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What d'ya got in there?
Are they following us?
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Darren, we better turn around.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
It's all over.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
Lake Forest Green?
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
Where'd you get this?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
He didn't say anything?
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
Well, let's hope not!
Steven...
Anything else?
You need to leave.
Legs giving you trouble?
What's the problem here?
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
Why did you want her body?
Lock this asshole up.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Randy, c'mon!
Wanna know how I did that?
Oh, my dear God...
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
What's wrong?
But I thought...
Where's the radio?
What are you doing in here?
Where did you get that alcohol?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
I demand to know what is going on...
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
I doubt very much that one even exists.
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
I...I can't...
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
I heard you weren't coming.
Rennie...??
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Very dangerous.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
Where are you going?
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
Shoot him.
What do you mean?
Of course I saw it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Is it?
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Opening night?
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
What will we talk about?
Why won't you tell me your name?
If you're wondering about the firearm.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
What do we want?
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
And you've been extremely patient.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
Life is good.
A thousand things.
Who is it?
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
How come you got the kid with you?
A grandmother. God bless you.
It's the kid's lucky day.
It's a complicated subject.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Because life is good.
Don't worry. It's a test.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
Postpone. We have every right.
Have to hurry back.
What do you mean?
Yes.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Yes.
There was a review.
So does Elliot.
And he has finer moments now and then.
You know what.
Is it true?
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Please! You're being foolish!
God gave you ten thumbs.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
That was lucky.
What are you doing?
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
What'd he say?
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
What do you want?
Do you find me stubborn?
You mean a general strike?
In England, I was a poor student but I --
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
Will you have a glass of sherry?
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
You almost sound like you believe that.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
What a pity.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
How often do you test, Director?
Good to see you're feeling better.
You okay, Jerome?
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
We can't stay here.
What makes them think that?
Come on--we're taking off.
If you say so.  The stripe.
I have your samples ready.
Where are you going?
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
Anything I've forgotten?
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
Not that.
Why don't we say we were together?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
So you didn't do it after all.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
What are you doing?
What about your wife?
That's your problem.
What do you add up to here?
You want to drive?
How does it taste?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
I mean it.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Yeah.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
If you don't start telling the truth... 
I'll bet you can.
Are you hungry?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
No more about Beynon.
Okay.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Yeah.
You're crazy.
You okay?
How long before this car's hot?
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
That's right.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Yeah. I got out.
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Let's just get to the border.
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
You got it.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
What's the damage?
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
How'd it happen, then?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Where's he living these days?
Everyhing go off all right?
What about?
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Why'd you see him so regular?
I call that regular.
You know Sid Fletcher?
I know him too.
Sid Fletcher.
Yes. I met him last year.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Yes, while he was here.
Could you do me a favour?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Sorry about your father.
That must be interesting.
You all right now?
Where's that?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
It's not like that, luv.
Are you a traveller?
Will this do?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Ta.
Now just a minute...
They bloody hurt me.
What about Keith?
You wouldn't.
Do you want breakfast?
They're friends of mine.
You coming back?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Not going, Jack?
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Ask me?
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
What's that? A hundred?
What's that?
Four hundred?
I'll see you, then.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
That's right?
For some sales pro...
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
Starting up.
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
...you're absolutely right.
Yes.
What could somebody get for them?
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Is that what I said?
Yes.
That's ridiculous.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Clear...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
They aren't?
Yes.
Thieves.
Will you excuse...
Shelly: get in the office.
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
...no...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
John.  John...
I'm out.
Of what?
I will close.
No.
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
Why?
Get 'em to me!
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Why I don't...
Excuse me...
You robbed the office.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
I...
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
Abso...
John: John:...my daughter...
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Shit.
I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm eating her crumb cake.
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
How was it...?
Fuck her...
"Always be closing..."
Harriett...
You closed 'em today?
Glad to meet you.
Home...
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
I've got to talk to you.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
What would have elapsed?
And when was that check cashed?
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
What's going on here?
She wants her money back.
No, Jim.
I'm...
What...?
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
What?
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Your farewell to the troops?
Have a good trip.
They got, listen to me...
Listen to me: They got some of them.
They took some of the con...
...Mr. Williamson...
Do you like them?
I can help you.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
What position did you occupy?
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
I understand...
Oh, 'scuse me.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
I never met them.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
Where's my wife?
Why didn't someone tell me!
Rocco!
Where's my brother?
Was it a boy or a girl?
I want it met.
What's up?
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
No strings.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Yes.
Why too late?
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
There are still things I have to do.
We do favors for each other...
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
This doubles my investment.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Says who?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
On the phone?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
What makes you say that?
Fuck you.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
I wasn't going to try anything.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
I'm not married.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
And your name is --?
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
No.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
So you had a wife?
Sorry.  Not today.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
No.  The girl.
Is that really her?
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
Do you mind?
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
What are you doing here?
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
Who was that at the door?
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
Yes?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
How's the leg?
What are you doing here?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
A boost. A big boost ...
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Fish.
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
Well, that certainly won't do.
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
What are you still doing here, Randall?
What do you want from me?
What's wrong with it -- ?
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
okay ...
You ever feel bad about any of this?
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
Forget that ...
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
No...
You all right -- ?
You sure you're okay -- ?
So what are you gonna do?
You can handle it?
You don't think so, huh?
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
Come here -
You boost her -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
He give you an advance -- ?
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
On account of Mitch?
And here I am...
And you got some Italians -- ?
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
She's trouble --
I go with you --
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
I do ... I cut "em...
Whatever do you mean?
You think it can be done?
Okay, then... Otto?
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
How old are you now, Toby?
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Uh ... Randall -- ?
What are you doing here, assface?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Stop! Stop!
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
We've got to help each other.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
What are you talking about?
Keep 'em coming.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
What'll I tell Fran?
Watch this.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
No way! You're kiddin'!
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
She's sharp as a marble.
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
You and Morgan throw?
Oh...
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
Is this a bad time?
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
--That isn't funny--
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Holy shit.
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
What's up guys?
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
You're in a safe place, Will.
Where is it touching you?
No, there's a limit.
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Sean.
Good to see you.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
Why me?
My kind of background?
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
He won't be a failure!
Hello, Sean.
Why there?
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
What do you want to do?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
I might understand that.
What?
That's very presumptuous.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Probably not.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
What is?
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
Well, are you going out again?
My wife's dead.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
I been there. I played my hand.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
I know.
You suck.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Yeah?
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
No I haven't...
Oh, you will?
You grew up around here?
I swear to God.
I want to meet them.
Where have you been?
I've never seen your place.
When?
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
How's it goin'?
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
Will? Are you awake?
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Why not?
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
I'd come back--
Any gas?
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Want to work?
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
They're all gone--or dead.
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
But we can still do it, honey.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
Been doin' a job?
Get to what?
You ain't got to get sore.
I didn't mean nothing.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
Where you going?
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
We gonna live here?
Anybody ask anything?
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
Ma, you sick?
Didn' you get no sleep?
When?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
I ain't full.
How's it feel, Tommy?
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
They know he got hit in the face.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
You can have this for ten cents.
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Morning.
Yes, sir.
Oh... really?
You're so funny...
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
I just play my own collection.
That's it?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Yes.
Flowers. That's funny.
You look beautiful.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
No time.
He was trying to kill you, right!
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
You went to school with these people.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Lisbon?
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Wait a minute--
They blame you for the compromise.
They were very upset.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
So what happened to you?
He sells BMW's?
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Doesn't matter.
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
He's beautiful.
Enjoy the day.
The answer's no.
Yeah.
Ever think of moving there full time?
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Oh, honey... What happened?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
How long is this going to go on?
That's not true!
He's still sitting in that damn field.
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
You got everything you need?
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
What are you talking about?
When? Tonight?
How's everything?
Yes. We're suing.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
What about Grace?
How was the dinner?
What did he say?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
When are you coming home?
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
No. I am a "tubab."
Where to?
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
What was it like?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
They fired you?
You don't seem to upset?
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
That's not a question, is it?
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
Grace, I need you to come with me.
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Don't be such a baby!
You shut up, stupid!
You're looking fit.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Let's keep her.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Shit!
Right.
What?
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Damn!
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
I found it! I found it!
Crash Override.
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
Yes!
And if I win?
Make it our first date.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Uhhhmm...
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
You're welcome.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Colonel who?
Die, dickweeds!
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
What the hell was that all about?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Hello, operator services.
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
Is there another key?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
When did this happen?
An accident?
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
How do we look?
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
Why not?
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Why shouldn't I?
Four plus Myers.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
What the hell did this?
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Sure it does.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Come on Rachel.
Jamie, what happened?
Come on Rachel!
Jamie, wait for me.
Had enough?
Rachel!
What are you doing out here alone?
You don't believe that do you?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You won't look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.
Where are you going?
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
Get the outside shutters.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
When he makes that call.
Something?
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Thank you.
Sort of.
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
It's been totally charted.
Sure.
I don't see anything.
He was standing right here.
Hello?
Annie, was that you?
Probably Mister Riddle.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
You locked yourself in.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
Is that all you say?
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Anybody live here?
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Jesus!
Sure...
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Yes, I am.
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
There WAS.
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
I'm scared!
Yes, she is.
There's nothing else I can do.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
Pull up to the entrance!
What did he say?
...any sister talk?
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Hi.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
What?
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
But I'm seeing him.
Yeah.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
How ya doin', man?
Hi, Dusty.
...with the affiliates.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Like, uh...?
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness!
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Yes.
Yeah.  How are you?
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
Is something wrong?
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Lee...
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why not?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
Oh, Mom!
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
Elliot lusts after you.
Like what?
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
But you don't have any symptoms!
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
No.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
So how are you?
Do you miss Frederick?
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
Go right over there.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
What?  You're kidding!
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Ohh?
Frederick didn't come with her.
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
You found all this, all this out on one date?
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Ohh!
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Good.
Hey, what's the matter?
Well--
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
I'd never do that.
People change...you know.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Have you?
Nobody ever said it.
Oh, I'm fine.
Right.
Oh!
Oh, wow!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Why are you so upset?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Aren't you glad to see me?
And?
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
Well.  Word gets around.
...how are things at the Hospital?
What have they got you doing?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
...aren't you afraid of me...?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Who would that be.
Evelda Drumgo.
You're ready now.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
First things first.
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Why did he come back?
<u>Do</u> it...
..It won't be long now, sir...
He don't like popcorn.
What would <u>that</u> be?
What reaction?
He is...?
...unmarked hundreds....
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
A fellow with five fingers.
I am all attention.
I know you did what you could.
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
What is that supposed to mean...?
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
I'm an orphan.
Waal...
Waited too long, hon...?  
Waal...
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
...yes.
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
And?  Then?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Who does not?
I require...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
You were given backup....
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Indeed we were.
What's that, Baby?
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
...what...?
Give me your gun...
Fine, thank you, but
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I don't understand.
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
...my love...
I am on the track of...
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
Thank you.
...what a lovely perfume.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
She must be something special After Dark.
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Man, she's losing it...
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Freeze!  You're busted!
Mine!
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
What are you doing?
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Iunno.  Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you <u>deliberately</u>                        ] destroyed us!

I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
So, are you a cheerleader?
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
All right.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Where did you get these?
What do you want from me?
Guess who?
What are you doing?
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
Shit.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
Do you take German?
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
It's over, J.D.  Over!
If you'll excuse me......
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
We on tonight man?
Any contestants worth mentioning?
You two....
You two....
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
 Got an A, Mum!
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
Who cares!
I'm educating myself!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You have it.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
But, we're all going to Heaven!
You'll never guess what's happened!!
John has fallen in love with me!
Let's go overseas . . .
Poor Father . . .
I'm coming with you.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Bye, Dad.
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
Of course, yes.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Pitbull attacks.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
I have my connections
GWEN?
Bret... what the fuck...?
You could say that.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
That was cold...
You win! Okay pull over.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
What evidence?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Are you ready?
Wait... what the hell is this...
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
The bathroom!  For two days?
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Often, uh.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
Bernie, how'sa kid?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Turn that thing off.
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
How'd it go?
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Ticket!  What's going on?
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
It's not unthinkable.
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Was that your dad?
Any particular brand?
And the rent is okay?
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
Do you have a family?
It's nice that you can make that choice.
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Neil -- what --
I know it's at the high end of our range --
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
And it's a shorter commute.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
Did you hear that?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
He wants to see me!
What -- what are you doing?
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
That's not the case.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Oh God.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
Let's follow 'em.
It's fun.
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Is it a king or a queen?
Even better.
Lieutenant?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
Tough.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
Sing.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
Maybe myself.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
France.
To ask her to dance.
Yes.
Well?
It will be a good harvest this year.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Aye?
Why?
Then take me with you.
Huge.
Yes.  How did you know?
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
If it's good advice.
Then who's Russell Nash?
Why do you stare at me like that?
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
No.
Yes.
Is it?
He's in there!
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
We found him this morning.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
You know it's not safe here for you.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
What are you doing?
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
I have to tell you something --
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
I'll give you these people.
That you, Talley?
We been through that.  Forget it.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
Can you identify this man?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
Are you out of your mind?
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
I need to work out some stuff.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Want one?
Kevin left without you.
Thanks for the shirt.
How can we get out?
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Is something wrong with Jane?
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
Let it go, Captain.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
How about you and your sister?
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
Is my daddy okay?
I think so.
What do you want me to do?
He has lots of disks.
Where are my children?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
Ten.
Give me it.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
What was the response?
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
They fired a rocket at us.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
What do you mean, General?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
You are a marked man.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
I committed no war crimes.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
) You cannot kill them all.
You fucking see that!
Here, have a sandwich.
Great, I really need a shower.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
Mr. Manager.
Where are we going, sir?
Are you sure this is the river road?
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Our cards, please.
You have our cards.
How much?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Your brother's here?
Thomas wants advice?
Let's have dinner first.
Do something.
They do not have your connections.
How can we help him.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
What's the matter?
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
What does it matter.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Twelve are dead.
The staff and guests! How many?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
Why the hurry, Roger?
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
More the merrier.
What are you playing here, Price?
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
What?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry --
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
This thing's going nowhere.
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
'Less the place really is haunted.
You said that was an accident.
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Pritchett, is that you?
Pritchett!
Thanks.
What? Deep down inside?
Cheery looking bunch.
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
You okay?
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
Don't touch me!
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Jesus!
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
You think this is fucking funny??
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
House 2, Guests 0.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
Sorry.
I'll take my chances.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Don't know that it does.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
And you think it's in there?
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
Price!
Pritchett: what is going on?
-- hey! --
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
Town records are coming up now.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
It looks delicious...
It will heal.
Good-bye.
It's going to hurt us!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Can you talk to her?
She's down...
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
She says she's lonely...
She's here.
She's down.  Help her...
I want this one, daddy.
I can't move!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Oh come on...
What will Aubrey think?
It's just going to take a while.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
God rest her soul.
Aubrey!
I'm fine.
Maura!
I think we should do it.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
Keep talking!
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
Where did you find this?
Hello?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Wha .... ?
What?
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
I'll boil some water.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Sure.  Why?
What am I looking for?
Joey ... ?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
You gonna buy?
Thank you.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Alex!
Cameras?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
Alex, are you....
How.
Don't you just hate kids...
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
Catholic girls are scary...
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
Bunny, not you too?
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Thanks for sharing.
If you do anything to my friend...
Snappy.
The Daddy-Oh!
The Hoopsucker!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
A sawbuck!
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Oh, Norville --
Your i --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Now, Amy --
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
Hey! Where's that martini?!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
...Geez.
Awwww, buddy --
...It is?
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
Geez, I --
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
...Yeah, go ahead.
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
You're fired.
Finally.
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Ya don't say.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
Yellowstone.
She isn't!
She's good, Bennie.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
I'd love to.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
It is not beautiful.
I suppose so.  Yes.
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
I told you.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
You want that?
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
An accident at the mill?
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
You're staring at me.
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
Good night.
What do you think?
You all right there?
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
Dinner in ten minutes.
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Don't start.
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Elena.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Grades?
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
See you.
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
Yeah?
What are you talking about?
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Mikey Williams?
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
I suppose. Why?
Please don't.
Forget what?
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
How can you do that man?
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
No candy for me?
Jesus, Jim!
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Maybe you should have just a half.
No one.
Want some gum?
Wow!
When worlds collide.
You get in trouble?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Hey Wendy.
All my model planes.
Want a drink?
It feels warm.
Yes, sir.
Good.
Just after Leland Street.
So far.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
I could say the same thing about you.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Thanks.
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
They're all over everybody.
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
He's just rattling your cage.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Fred Duggar?
What if someone finds out?
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
I don't know.
Down at the station?
What about him?
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
I told you that was an accident!
Your lips, they didn't move.
Who made us what we are?
I was waiting for you...
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
I want some more.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Louis, look at me.
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
This is monstrous!
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
You want death? Is it death you want?
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Dear God, what have I done?
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
I know. It gets cold so fast.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
We belong in hell.
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
She's here, your wounded one.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
And they frighten you?
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
You loved your wife, surely.
But why did you tell her?
Did he die in the fire?
No... it can't end like that...
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
Yes.
What can I do for you?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Your what?
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
Get lost, you scared me.
The number's unlisted...
But, he said he'd try.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
Karaoke -- perfect.
No way.
What do you mean?
There's no way to lock it.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Yeah.
Ray, I can't...
I understand something.
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
I'm sorry.
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
Deep breaths --
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
I trusted you.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Pretty cool bar.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Jeez, that's a full carat --
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
We will see who is the first to die.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
I have forgotten it, dear.
I felt he did not like me.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic!
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in —- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me —— a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
There is something evil about her.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Well, tell, him.
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
But they're somebody's children.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
Stand back.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
You have no car.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
No.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
What?
She's . . .
Where? I don't see a thing.
A boy?
Who is it?
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
What's that?
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Well?
Hi, Daddy.
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Old college graduate now, huh?
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
What's that?
Goodbye, everybody!
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Oh, no –– you don't feel so good.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmmm . . .
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Well, no younger than I was.
How's that?
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Got a match?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
No, George, don't . . .
Well, what do you know –– wife.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Now look, did you buy anything?
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Well, why don't you say it?
What'd you wish, George?
Ouch!
About what?
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Is it snowing?
Where's your coat and hat?
For me...?
Wheee!  Faster!
The lighthouse?
What is it?
Throw it.
I thought you said she was going with us?
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
Hey!
On your own time?
What about that camera?
You're too close.  Back off.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Because.
Pop....
Michael.
Mike?  Is that you?
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The what?
The whale's mouth?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Where the hell were you?
Let's get the kid home.
Mmmm.
Where's my day book?
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
One what?  Ah-ha!
No.
I know what you're going to say.
Sean's asleep.
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
I'll give notice.
What is it?  What's the matter?
Are you serious?
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Martin, it could be anything.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Where the hell is Air One?
Yeah?  Then what?
We're going to die.
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Terry!  You okay?
Me neither.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
What about the others?
What're we going to do in the mean time?
Mmmmmm.
Right after, the Kids went out?
About damn time.
It comes here from Cable Junction.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I don't care.
He's got to help or it won't work.
Who wouldn't.
You're going sailing.
I want to go with you!
Yeah.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
Be reasonable, please....
Don't feel bad.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Well, not much longer to go.
Yeah.
You called, Doctor?
How come?
And what else is bothering you?
Yeah, you really don't like him.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Are you scared?
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
And leave me down here???
Don't think about it.  It's over.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
Honey, what is it?
Come on.
I am.  You're not.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
I told you, something's upset them.
I'm sorry.
You look like an orange worm.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Musclehead?
So, you just get here?
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
I'm a water-skier.
How come?
You were great out there!
Sean, do you have herpes?
Besides that.
Yes, it's great!
Told you you'd like it.
Let's go, let's go!
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Yeah, well I didn't!
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Daddy, why can't I...?
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
Like mother, like son....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
No fair, I'm not armed.
Sweetheart....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
That hurt....
Don't be late.
Sit down, Ma....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
You could teach...You could....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
It got him....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
Flies the plane....
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
What are you doing?
The kind with an umbrella in it....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
What happened?
How many...?
I stuck them on, man....
Hey!
They won't fight with me....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
Okay...we got it together....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
You sure you've done this before?
And it's always worked?
What's so funny about that?
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
Half don't...Bring her about....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
I don't like it....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'A Moray eel....'
I don't like the song.
You told me what?
Holy Christ....
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
Who grows more beautiful....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
What about that kid, Ross?
What do you think?
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
We're going.
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Stop it.
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
What do you want me to do, Chief?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
Did he get you the job?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
Yes, Sir.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
You just asked me to ask you questions.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
I know what you're like ..
I have to talk to you, Helena.
Why?
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
Yeah, I guess I do.
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
What was she like?
You think he still loves her?
So tonight she confesses?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
I have to finish my job --
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
Listen to me!
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Now what did you lose?
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
That took guts.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Hey you.
Oh my God.
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Beer okay?
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
If I said that, would you stay?
Why do you love me?
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I don't need you to "stick."
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
That's the girl I love.
Forgot your keys --
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
I got it.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
You love me now, don't you?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
--  the kwan.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
What's wrong.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
That's an answer.
I have to ask.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
To the pools?
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
How can I make your life better?
You gonna get that --
I'm fine.  What's up?
Pardon me?
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
He should have kept his head tucked down.
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Eric!
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
He says it's a bad idea!
How much weight have you lost?
You hate to swim.
That's him. That’s Eric!
I don't remember
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
ALAN!
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Good luck with the fund raising.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
That's hard to believe.
Billy!
How do you mean?
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
What?
I don't believe you.
Are you looking for a problem?
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I could come with you.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
What kind of gun is that?
What?
What in Christ's name is going on?!
Where's the power and radio setup?
We took to the rock.
It's... behind... us.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
You version of it.
What's he got in there?
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
She's gutty.
What are they?
Head for the roof!
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
Ian.  It's guano.
Where's Kelly?
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
Pretty sure.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
The movement!
Oh, shit.
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
No. We can't.
It's all right.
I know, it's very exciting.
It's anti-nature.
Alan, listen to this.
Oh, imperfections?
Alan?
Dino droppings?
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?
Why not?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
So am I going to help you with your foot?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
You're married?
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Oh my God!
Hey, we were saving that!
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
Ah - - they're here.
Dad - - Dad - -
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
It's safe.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
We miss you.
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I hate trees!
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
Jesus Christ!
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
What?
What's going on?
What are the charges?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Sorry.
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
You're not going to be there?
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
What's that?
Fine -- terrible.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Just what you've published.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
Well, I --
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
They're not obliged to tell.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Gabriela ...?
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
I'll bear that in mind.
... A piece of paper ...
-- You seem amused.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
What's the matter?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
All these in the last year?
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
What have you got there?
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
There's a light up ahead.
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Did you see her?
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Yes?
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
Guess!
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
What is it?
What about?
Who?
Honest?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
You remind me of my uncle.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
He never told me.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It's kind of late.
What's the matter?
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
How can you do it to yourself?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
Please.
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
Is that all you have to say?
Go down in my room.
Where'd you spend last night?
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
John, how are you?
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Town Police.
I know Tom Grunemann.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
Well?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Greatest.
On earth.
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
When is mommy coming back?
Uh, huh...
Mom, I mean dad...
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
See.  That's my name.
Is that really your chair?
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Mom--I mean, dad?
What did you do when you were little?
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Your mom.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Objection.
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
And how did you find his work?
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
I don't recall.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
So...what's so terrible about that?
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Yeah?
And?
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
What if I fight it?
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
You ever see her talk to the walls?
Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Things? What kind of things?
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Mama, my story.
I do, now.
Dalai Lama.
And the United Nations? Surely?
With much bloodshed.
Holiness?
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Is that big?
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
I am scared.
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
They will take Lhasa next.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
Do you think I must?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Things change, Kundun.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
You will not come?
You, kill me?
I do.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
Like my mother.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
I might get a shot.
Go!!!
We'd only just met.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
I'm laying a spring trap!
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Is this a trick?
No!
He never said "go".
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
No way.
I got something on the screen.
Where is he?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
You take care.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
What?
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
In Maine?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
What are you doing?
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
Okay.  We're up at six.
You okay?  Kelly?
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
Sorry.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
I'm not mushing it.
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
Watch out!!
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
You said nobody came in here!
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
This is a little different.
Not yet.
You're sort of a rude person.
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
Are you alright?
Hank?
Are you okay?
Hank!
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
I had a great time last night. Again.
That's not what you came to say.
I'm not even a field person.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
<u>You</u>?
Boy, is that smart...
Lecter said a lot of things.
"- every day."
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
You're all right! Where is he?
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Okay, Miss Starling?
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Miggs has been murdered.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
You seem pretty sure of that.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
And the questionnaire...?
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Yes.
Two months.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
I heard a strange sound...
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Where were you going?
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
Time, Pilch! My move.
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Your "father"?
He did?
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
And my compliments to you...
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
How far is it, scout?
What?!
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
Head for... for the white water.
Where do we go from here?
I don't understand!
Any powder?
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Yes.
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Their arms?
Qui vive?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
Was there such a thing?
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Where the hell've you been?
Your suit, Becky!
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
How's astronaut training?
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Shut up, all of you.
No!
Oh, God, she's out there...
I'm going inside.
Okay, number 23's full.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Thank you, Martin.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
You got money in this tub?
Personal effects...
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
How'd you do that?
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
How is he?
What's wrong, did you miss me?
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
How much did you part with?
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
I don't know what you mean.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Nope.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
They were going to pay, then?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
We gotta get those guns.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
What they like then?
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.

Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Where?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
You what? What are you on about?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
What do you mean?
You and me, Tom.
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
That's if I want to see you.
I'll see ya.
That you, boy?
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
How many wings have they got between them?
The money, the gear!
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
And what did she do?
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Out of the Army?
We're not running a dating service here.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
Just wondering.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
What's that for?
I'm not picking it up.
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Best part of the job.
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
350 pounds.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
You've been in this house for a while?
So how come you got into all this?
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Mikey--
So where does that put us?
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Eladio Cruz.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Is very beautiful, your car.
Senora Cruz?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
Tell that one, Hollis--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Historic occasion, isn't it?
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
I haven't been out here for a while.
No.
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
Fellas.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
Your mother's family is Spanish?
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Mami, how old were you when my father--
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
Mrs. Bledsoe?
People didn't complain?
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
Mom?
Can I get this?
How come?
It was for personal consumption.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
Murdered him?
Something wrong?
Got him here?
I thought you got through that pretty well.
People liked him.
Your boy, there--
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
I mean what did we know about anything?
So what are we gonna do about this?
Yeah?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
We start from scratch--
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
How 'bout you?
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
You ever been married?
Right.
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
If you've lied to me to me --
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
How did it go today?
So why did you marry him?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
You said you weren't with him for love.
What then?
...yes?
Valentin?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
What about me?
Sure.
What makes you so sure?
They weren't worth a damn.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
With what?
Whose is the car?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
What the fuck are you doing here?
I like to know why things happen.
Are you satisfied now?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
D'Amour --
Don't bother.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
Harry D'Amour.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
They got here before us.
This is where we killed him.
He did something with the ground.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Have we met before?
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
And?
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
Oh, hi.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
I don't want to go home.
Hello?
Charlotte, who?
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Oh.
I know.
Four.
What happened to your toe?
It's bad isn't it?
Where's your husband?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
What do you want to drink?
So, where'd you go today.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Well... have a good flight.
Why are you crying?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Yeah, its really different here.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
It's ok.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Hospital?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
How'd it go today?
You wanna come?
Hair stuff?
Its bad for you.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
I missed you.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
Peter, where are you?
I'm still shaking.
Yeah, like...
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Seemed...on edge.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
What is it?
You fucking bastard.
You raised me, like a son.
Why are you doing this to me?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Two negatives always make a positive.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
I'll bet.
So what'd I miss?
We need to talk.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
So what?
Peter, let go of the chair!
You okay?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
There's nothing else here.
Are you alright?
What about after?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
How much time do we have?
Hello?
Maya?  What do you mean?
And what are you thinking we should do now?
It's useless...look at him.
Good of you to stop by.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
What do you mean by that?
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
Parents died?
She told me she killed them.
Ah, Mom.
That's not funny
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
So what do I do?
Whatever.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
I can take it.
What?
Coach...
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
What?
Careful.
That was nice.
Damn, girl.
I don't wanna see that.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
Mom's going to hate it.
I know...
This brother from my college.
You ever been in love?
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
Hey, munchkin.
Thanks, Sidra.
I know.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
Your Dad play?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I don't like flowers.
I think we gotta kiss now.
I want to ride my own bike.
So?
I don't have to do what you say.
A ride home.
That's it, give it your best shot.
You don't look half-bad.
Hey.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Sorry about your game.
he's just playing, Q...
Hey.
Least she had time for me.
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
You're what?
So...how's the knee?
It just isn't.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
You're out of your mind.
Zeke.
We should head over.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Later when?
Whose truth are you talking about?
Quincy, please...
Why not?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Oh, she's fine.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
What do you want? Why are you here?
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
Don't sit down.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Your mother wants to hear from you --
OPEN THE DOOR.
For what?
No.
No.
No.
ok.
About two years ago.
Yeah.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
This is my job.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
No.
Yeah.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Eight o'clock?
Great, bye.
So you've done it --
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
I lost my gun.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Just say no.
What's your name?
-- what kind?
Have you ever been there?
C'mon guys, settle down --
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
How much you pay me for my help?
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
What?  What does that mean?
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
Picky, picky.
I'm sick.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You mind your own bussines.
I've been a good worker --
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
I think you have the wrong number.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
I'm gonna start rolling --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
Where are you from originally?
Why does that sound silly?
I wouldn'tve asked --
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Where does that name come from?
How long have you taken care of him?
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
Is he in pain?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
He's in here --?
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
I am calm.
Marcie.
I didn't do anything.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
What the hell is this Marcie?
You look great.
I'm sorry.
I can't fuckin' do this.
What were you saying, Stanley?
How you doing?
-- did she talk to you?
I love you.
You're my handsome man.
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
Two years...three years...
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
But you can't say....
Hello?
I'm Bob.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
I can't.
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
Pink Dot.
yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
I don't have regular classes anymore.
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
The fuck is wrong with you?
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
You ready to keep winning?
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
..sorry...
Hi.
What is that?
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Louis, please -- !
Your Majesty...
It can.  I know the way.
What are they doing?
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
More wine!!
You can do it.
Three days.
Go on.
We must stop him!
He seeks redemption.
Then to the Bastille.
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
No!  Stop --
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
But why?
Coming?
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
But -- are you sure?
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
D'Artagnan!
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
Athos, please...!
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Are you hungry?
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
A personal nature?
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Exactly why it should be given away.
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
Every step of the way.
It's Marvosa -
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
Yeah?
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
Did you hit him?
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Alright, where is she?
Are you alright?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Where is he?!!
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
And what did you do?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
No...I'm in some trouble...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Oh man...what happened?
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Where are you going?
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Ditched you?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
What?
What about him?
It was you who did the asking.
I wouldn't presume to try.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
What have we missed?
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
How long do I have?
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
Where?
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Is it weird?
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
He's a very shy boy...
Something Lecktor said.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
It's getting late and...
It's the guard in the storeroom.
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
Is that you. D?
I'll get my purse.
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
'No' what?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
You will tell the truth?
Do you have it?
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
I want to see Lecktor now.
Can you read it to me?
Yeah...
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
'Intimate? !"
I understand he cut you pretty good...
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
And... where are things?
Is Crawford going with you?
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
What do you want?
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
Are you gonna kill him?
How?
You went in the apartment?
Did you get my card?
Pray tell.
What disadvantage?
Pictures?
Do you dream much, Will?
What were the yards like?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
May I keep the file?
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
Why does it feel good?
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
I'm sorry, George...
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
You must take a little pleasure in it.
Tony Clifton.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Hi...
Andy, the theater's that way!
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Have you told your family?
You're NOT DYING!
GET OFF!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
I'm gonna quit.
Give me the book.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
I was very original!
Excuse me, Andy...
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
That was a really hot house!
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Why is he saying these things?!
Sure...
You don't know.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
He's gonna make it.
Weird.
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
Do you?
You don't, do you?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
Hello, Trinity.
Thanks... for the drink.
What is he doing?
Holy fucking shit!
The cubicle across from you is empty.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
What are you doing?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
How did I beat you?
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
Set down in there.
How does she know?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Got it.
Tank.
How...?!
How did you do that?
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
What is this thing?
Is it?
Should I be?
What did she tell you?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
What?
What are you doing?
Are you all right?
Morning.  Did you sleep?
You don't have...
It's a city?
See who?
How?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Why?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Neo!
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
Yeah.
May God be with you.
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Who's the girl?
Nervous?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Panther...
Waddaya think?
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Let's get out of here.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
Shut up!
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
Nope...
Hey, shut up.
Oh Michael, look...
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
Diane, how are you feeling?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Well, maybe you missed something?
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Please take it.
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
You mean it's heisted.
Yeah.
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Just plain 'Joe'?
That was 'Joe'.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Daddy!
I know you do, darling.
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
Honey, please.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
Hello, Beautiful.
And what would that be?
I didn't say.
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Yes.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
No.
Perhaps you could remind me.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
In my sleep.
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
It's going to be great --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
'Joe...'
Sit down, Drew.
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
Whose?
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
What you then?
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
No, I come to see Doctor.
I am.
Jennifer.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
I am Joe.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
She's in a great deal of pain.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
I mean I appreciate that.
No, I'm not.
'To bed'?
You first.
More than you love peanut butter?
I like you in a black tie.
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
We know so little about each other --
I believe that, don't you?
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
I want to live.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Now I'd like to be alone.
Truly - uh - splendid.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
Okay.
Why did you go to the hospital?
About Susan?
What way would you put it?
I'm sorry, Bill --
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
And I don't give a shit.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Then what is it?
Joe, don't do this --
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
An offense --
Not exactly.
Yes.
You want me to be your guide --?
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
I think you know --
Where are you?  Are you there?
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
'Take me'...?  Where?
'The one' to do what?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
...There's a start for a meeting.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Nothing.
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
How'd you know?
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
I've got patients coming in --
Why?
79.
66.
69.
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
How long have I been here?
So you're holding my calls?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Is that what your little note says?
Why?
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
They treating you alright?
Sleep okay?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
Why would you do that?
Did you?
How?
They're not looking for him.
You're the memory guy?
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
I'm not appealing the decision.
You've read it a hundred times.
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Who?
Why are you here?
I don't think so.
Who the fuck are you?
Unfinished business.
Why's that?
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
How'd you know I was in here?
Why?
How do you know him?
What's wrong?
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
You probably.							 *
Why would I do that?						    *
I should kill you.							 *
With Sonny.  110%.
Yeah?
I don't know.
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
I got the item.
My end?
What's "nothing"?
I insist.
You know how improbable this is...?
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Is this the protective male talk?
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
What is it?
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
Then it don't work.
What do we got?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Hello?
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
Never heard of him.
Out of...?
Yeah...?
They had me from the gate.
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
And...?
Why?
That sonofabitch!
Equipment?
What do you care?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
You ain't coming to work?
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
I can tell, can't you?
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
For money.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
What's in your socks?
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Keep the goddam blanket on.
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
What d'you want?
What you got me up here for?
Listen, I gotta have money.
Ready for hard work, son?
Sold. Let's go.
Tunnel?
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
You got that, shit face? Asina...
What?
To what?
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
Dad...I'm...
Where you staying, Dad?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Where are the minefields?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
...are you with the Consulate?
How's it feel?
Feeling all right?
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Get the... midnight... express.
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Okay?
We go back.
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
Oh we... we...
Just got some news on Bell.
I think I've been poisoned.
You're ayip!
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
I only got...
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
Which way?
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Honey, just leave it.
No, Jesus, no.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
Rub it on the windows!
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
You sure you didn't see one of these?
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
The profanity bothers you?
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
You want me to burn my book?
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
See, isn't this nice?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
It'll only take a second.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
Well, it certainly says you.
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
You've been out of your room.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
Don't talk to me like that.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
I thought you were over it.
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
You won.
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
Where?
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
Not exactly.  Wallis?
Well do you disagree with that?
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
Before we kill her or cure her..
How're we doin', then?
Uh-huh.
Where's the bloody -
- this is very disconerting..
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
Hola..
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
Have you met them?
-- his left jacket pocket.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like what?
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Very.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
I don't.  No exactly.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
..I'm fine..and you?
Roger that.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Luther, I'm looking at security.
A visit from an old friend.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
To friends.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
That's S.O.P..
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Satisfied?
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
I'm walking.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
Where were you?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
The message is for Job.
I just need you to be safe.
Are you damaged?
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Yes.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
We've lost enough agents for one night.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
What?
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
It's quite out of the question.
Why should I?
Very good.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
I thought I'd take some now.
Why not?
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Jim...?
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Why don't you take a look?
That's what we do isn't it?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Yes...  Itís him.
Whatís the problem.
Uh-huh
Okay.
I don't wanna talk about it.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Where's Ma?
You look tired.
Yeah.
Johnny Cammareri.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Yeah.
Here.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
Yes!
Why didn't he call himself?
What's wrong can never be made right. 
I like it well done.
This is good. Uhh...
Where'd Johnny find you?
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Stupid yourself.
She was right to leave me.
You don't know nothing about it.
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
Son of a bitch!
You don't get along with anybody!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright.
Who painted that?
So. Where are we sitting?
Let me go home.
He's coming.
Hi Loretta.
You don't want the fish.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
What's the matter?
Will you marry me?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
Alright. A month. In a month.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
He's my younger brother.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
Did he tell her?
Your hair's different.
Are you drunk?
What about the moon?
Hi, Loretta.
Alright.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Don't fight.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Who was that?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
May I presume to ask you a question?
Thanks, comrade.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Go ahead.
Temperature's dropping.
I'm a little cold.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
Look.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Burn them.
I see.  Yes, of course.
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What is that?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
I move for no man.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Hello.
Nu!
They're nervous, sire.
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Je...sus Christ!
Oh, shut up.
Old woman!
Well you could say: "Dennis"
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Yes, Lord.
Good idea, O Lord!
I feel fine.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
Don't be such a baby.
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Gosh - Is he all right?
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
Rather what?
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
Yes ...  make sure ...
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Well, look er, I ...
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
Sir Gawain.
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Hurry!
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
I done it again.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
You should have someone look after you.
Hey, Barney.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Gesture?
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
By whose authority?
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
Checked and locked, sir.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
This is a slur on her good name.
What brings you here?
She'll never understand it.
Mr Brown.
And the pony?
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
John?
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
Is that not enough?
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
What did he want?
We're going to lose.
What's her excuse this time?
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
Has he been hurt?
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
What is the matter with him?
How the hell did you do that?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
Has anyone seen Greg?
What's her problem?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
So where is he?
I have to talk to you.
No, in person.  Now.
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
What do you mean by "weird"?
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
Well?
Where to now?
You mean we learn the rules...
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Virgin sacrifices?
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
Jesus Christ!
What are you looking for?
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
You feel it?  It's different this time.
The clock's already ticking.
Our time's up.
We can't reach that!
What is it?
So tell me you're okay, then.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Which way?
I'm thinking!
Mom?  You're alive...
But I don't understand...
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
So start at the beginning...
Someone's shut off my money!
What do you mean "you know"?
Will you meet with him?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
So what's the problem?
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
What did I say?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
It will work out.
Yes...what is it?
... What??
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
I...
I guess I've come to quite a place.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
There was an accident. I came here.
No, no, I'm fine.
Number 17.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
What is it Rita?
I don't know.
Mulholland Drive.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Okay... but just...just to see.
Okay.
"So... surprise"...
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
Don't stop!
Those men in front, in the car.
No, we don't.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
Yeah, they showed me
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Is that it ?
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
So what do we do ?
What are you doing ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
How long till the room fills ?
So why this ?
He hired you to build this place ?
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
I... I .....
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
What was that ?
What are you DOING here ?
That was eleven years ago.
Yeah a real shame.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
Be very, very quiet...
Hey, try swimming. It works.
Is it over ?
Where ?
Don't eat at the console.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
But, he's...
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
When you are ready.
You did.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
Of course.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Zachary.
What is Bruce doing ?
Maybe you should get over fears.
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
What the ... ?
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Hello.
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
What now ?
He was right behind me !
Good morning.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Do you still teach?
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
This is California, anything is possible.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
I don't think you're very polite.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
Do what?
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Seriously.
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
No nuns, got it.
What does that mean?
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
Hi.
What are you staring at?
What's the matter?
Is it okay if I drink this?
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
This is really very nice of you.
There's water in your bathroom.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
I don't need you to be telling me to...
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Get married?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
You ratted on my mother??
I think it's cool.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
It's dangerous!!
You mean,  this ring?
It's not his fault!
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
No?
Wow!
Committed?
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
I think this place is just fine.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Bye Aunt Rose.
So what's wrong?
I mean...with your car.
Excuse me?
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Something wrong?
Well I'm sort of involved.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Of what??
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
Danny?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Ex...ex, ex...
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Can't you see it?
It's still available I hope?
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
They're dead?
You don't like it?
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
Hi.
Does it make it easier to win?
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Dance with me?
I haven't danced in.....
I ahh, better go.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Shelly?
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Goodnight Vada.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
Really?
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Please.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
No....
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
No.
She's shy.
He won't give it to me.
Big Ringo fan.
Did you read ALL these books?
What are they about?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Are you going out somewhere?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
No.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Hmmmm, interesting.
Who's that with your Dad?
What do you think it's like?
Hi Vada.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Get up!?
I do, she's real funny.
Well when you get older, you just have to.
You better not either.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
Blood oath.
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
Neosporin?
I give.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
Excuse me?
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
Jesus, we're trapped!
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
And she's all wrong for me!
Please come, please.
What's the sec...
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Waiter! Check, please!
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
Big weddings are so strange.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Will she like it?
I asked you...
Thank God you were here.
... your one chance for true happiness?
The Big Hurt, huh?
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
And to m...
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
Maybe it's happy there.
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
What?
No.
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Am I disturbing you?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
You bet.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
How is she?
That's what he wants.
Well, how about the shopping center?
You're kidding.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
He's my father.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Well, Mr. Green.
Mr. Green?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
You in music?
What kind?
Do you like him?
I'm not sure. Where?
Hello.
I don't know who you are.
Oh?
Wrong.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
Hello.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
I mean...
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Come on back to bed.
What do you think of him?
Oh --
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Got me an audition tonight.
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
You sure do it loud.
It's not bad.
You think it will?
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
Naw, she don't mind.
Hasn't it?
Divine intervention.
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Who is we?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
You've heard of it?
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Say something.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
You ready, Donut?
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Not to anybody. She sings.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Tell me about the purity.
Says the United States of America.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Yes.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
And they made the first move?
Hypnotizing.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Yes.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
How immediate is immediately?
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
And where do you keep Mickey?
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
Okay, boys, let's have it.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
I see.
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Yeah.
They done that too long in my family.
Give her a beer.
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
Want to talk to you.
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
I know.
Yeah.
What d'you want?
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
His profession?
Any other family?
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
How 'you doin' man?
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
How d'you mean?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Get out of here!
Let's go, Duff.
That's why you come back, huh?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
But I would like to see you again.
I wouldn't have let you.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Surprised?
How old is your boy?
Thank you.
What about that girl?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
What's wrong?
Hmmm - good coffee.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Don't, Duff.
Hi.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
No point fixin' it!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Duff, I love you.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
Okay.
What's so hot 'round town?
That's right.
They all got families to support.
'See ya.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
Hello.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Let's stay here, Will.
Shut up, Will.
He's your son.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
We got any shots?
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
What are you doing in here?
What you lookin' for, mon?
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
What are you talking about?
You ran without us.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
She's ready to go.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
Want to fucking answer them?
And we really do have to talk.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
You've been calling her name.
That's not going to help.
I'm going in.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Yeah... fine.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
I know.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
What is with this school and prom?
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Oh, man! Who told?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
No Roger from op/ed?
You're Pam?
Guess who I did it with last night...
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Okay. That's bad.
Hi!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Wow. It's packed.
George! What are you doing here?
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
That's your story!
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Hey--what are you thinking about?
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Better person than I.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
What!?
Are mom and dad here?
You're twenty-three years old!
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
This seat taken?
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Yes.
That is so sad --
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Aloha! Welcome!
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Are you having fun?
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
Wow - I-
By name.
We followed your instructions.
Shock.
Not at all!
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
If you went away, what would become of me?
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
Coming...
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
Jesse, help!
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
So, you live around here.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
What's all this.
What is it - What's wrong?
What is it?
It's gone now.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
'Morning.
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
What's that?
You're going out?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
I'm serious.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Jennifer --
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
What's happening?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
I used to live in this house.
That was different.
What's that?
Are you okay?
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
You got five minutes.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
It's over.  It's over.
Anything?
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
I've heard crazier things this week.
Nancy...
Who is he?
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
What was that?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
Freddy.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Why is he after us?
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
Wait a minute.  What about me?
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
And then I... right.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Are you busy tonight?
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
I'm sorry.
Why?
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
Hi.  Can I come in?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
With a goat playing a violin.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Well...
That's not true.
You disappeared.
You were saying...
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
No.  Not true...
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bernie.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
I was called and I came.  What's up?
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
I agree.
Well, fire away.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Max.  This is Anna.
So I get the brownie?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Cool, huh?
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Right.  No one else?
Try 'Flintstone.'
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Oh my God...  Hello.
Maybe.
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
But you have no proof.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
M-m-m-ma'am?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Tell us about it...
Get up, Billy.
Yes, ma'am...
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
I'm not finished yet.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
That's it! We made it!
So do I!
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Mister McMurphy.
I hope everything is settled.
Whatcha boys playin'?
What's your name, buddy?
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
A bus?
What is it, kid?
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Yeah, Mack?
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
What?
Mine, too!
What are you doing?
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Did to me?
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
So why are you talking to him?
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
You can come back later!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Don't you have any clubs?
Who told you that?
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Is that so?
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
How are you feeling?
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
How do ya know that?
You think it's funny, huh?
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Got a cigarette?
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
You know, I never got your name.
He's a patient, Rose...
Yeah...
Hi.
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Hit me!
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
At this hour?
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
She was your sister.
Your grandmother?
May I see your boarding pass, please?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
No, really.  What's she doing?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Good.
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
No.
...has a prior commitment.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Smoking or non-smoking?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
I'd really rather not say.
Nice dress.
You were saying...
So were you.
How about music?  You like classical?
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
Hi.
No.  Are you're leaving?
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
What would you call it?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
Been here long?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Well, to-- new friends.
Faith, this is my mother.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
How about the other one?  His friend.
Scientologist.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
You don't have any idea?
Kate, is something the matter?
I have vacation time coming to me.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Live happily ever after.
You okay?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
We're saved!
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
That was a long time ago.
Hi-iii...
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
A porco?
Oh.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I came after the woman I love.
Yeah--
She what?!
I have to talk to her.
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
That's right... .
Mm—hmmm.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
See! You don't understand!
It was you, Charley... .
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work— with all them muscles. 
I think we're O.K.
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
You know how the Sisters are.
The moment I saw you.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
I'd better go in.
The Golden Warriors.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
You don't believe in anything, do you?
You haven't finished your beer.
You're not sore at me?
What are you going to do?
Pigeons... .
I've been sittin' in the church.
You... .
I know what you want me to do!
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Edie.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
I don't get it!
Now don't give me a hard time.
Your gun.
Give me that gun.
What did you say?
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
I think you could have.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys— 
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Boy, you must've been up early.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Give me a double.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
You ought to go home and take care of that—
Terry?  What do you want?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
I— I musta counted wrong, boss, I—
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
What do you mean?
Look!
I am--It's our only chance.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
...And what is this?
Well?
The moon is almost gone!
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
Then it is some service you desire of us.
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
I said not as a rule.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Oh, is this Adele?
I want to speak with you, please.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
You didn't visit him in prison.
Why not?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
You're good.
You were his what, his box?
Where in the hell are we?
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
What?!
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
You find out?
They look like plain old rocks.
What?
We made it, didn't we?
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Daniel.  Listen --
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
You excited?
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Karen, I told you not to--
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Who's sitting here?
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
Nervous?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
You don't act like it.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
That's my dad.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Unless you wanna tell me.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
You did?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
You were going to see her?
You're not dumb.
So.  What's your point?
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
Looks like tonight.
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Foley?  That you?
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Meaning?
You busted out?
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
That was some shit, huh?
Hi, Ray.
How's it going?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
Can we change the subject?
No thanks.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
You were talking in your sleep.
You wave back?
Out for the evening?
Thank you...
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Foley's got it.
I found a rubber.
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
How could you do this?
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Nah, you go on.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
I'm out of ammo!
It's not getting any longer.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
It must of been a convincing letter.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
Leapin' Jesus!
Do you believe in all of that?
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Do you have to wear that hat?
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
The only one?
They're waiting. Come on.
I'll call you Later.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
What happened?
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
You got a Tab?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Want me to drive you home later?
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, how are you?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
What do you know about classical music?
But what has to be different?
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
What're you doing here?
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
I love you.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Hello, Charlie.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Are you for real?
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
You don't?
This is great reefer.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Young lady, you're drunk!
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Quiet today?
He'll win.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Where have you been?
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell—O.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
Don't eat the red ones.
And the butter.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty—fifty.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
What do you know about hypnosis?
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
What's the matter?
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Is something wrong?
What happened to you?
I think so.
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Why not?
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
Jesus.
What in God's name... ?
This time. What about next time?
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
Thanks, you guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
Why are you getting dressed?
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
I'm not ready to die.
Whatever.
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Innocuous?
Kids are great.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Who'd you get?
One more thing, Your Honor...
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Beckett?
I know a good probate lawyer.
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
Rach.
What can I do?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Do you need a break?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
No. I can't really see it.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Mom?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Objection!
Leave that.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
Lots.
Don't know, Joe.
Joe?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Don't wanna miss this.
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
What whispers?
But I just wanted to say --
What do you see? Riddick?
Back to the ship, huh?
Here. Make it easy on you.
Just give me your hand.
You'd die for them?
How many bottles?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
We just keep him locked up forever?
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
So you noticed too?
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
This does not help us, Johns.
Frightening thought.
Imam. Slow down.
Where's Mr. Johns?
And pointless.
"God is Great," yes?
...then we saw this.
What the hell are these?
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
I apologize.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Where does the river lead?
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
'I am not a missing link.'
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
How did it go?
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
He's trying to form words.
Landon! Send a last signal.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Who are you?
I want her.
I told you not to bring the other one.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Sustained.
What about me?
Of course.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Of course.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
He's moving his fingers!
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
But the proof? The doll?
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
So what's the problem?
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
You lame Taylor?
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Taylor! Francis!
First time?
But what'd she actually do?
Dawn! That was it!
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
You wanted to see me sir?
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Indefinitely?
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
No thanks?
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
Your liquor laws..
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Want a spike in it?
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Want to dance?
Why not?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
See anything?
No.  I paid him off.
Mitchell was dead enough.
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Please answer my question.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
We try to be decent.
If I understand what you meant by that.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
I can't answer that.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
Private eye?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Who told you my name?
Where?
It could have been an accident.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
You asked me where it all came from.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
What do I get for it?
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
You in charge here?
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Was that about the right angle?
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
I am a fool.
So far.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
What's this?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I told you she's just..
Right.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Attributed?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
Oh yes?
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
I called you a taxi.
Why not stay?
Jeremy phoned this morning
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
That's enough of that.
Perhaps I will, then.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
What period?
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
Hello, Jimmy.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
We'll see what we can do.
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Thanks for stepping in.
Don't you gamble?
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
How you figure?
Ever done this before?
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
What's this?
We're wasting time.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
You never were...
Yeah?  What?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
What?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Good move.
Sorry.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Got it.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Time for lunch.
The hell are they?!
Angelo!  Don't fire!
What do you want?
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
You had enough?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
My name's Johnny Utah!
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Why us?
What story did you give to Davis?
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
Thanks.
What's got Billy so spooked?
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
Where the hell is his body?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
It's... it's not like that.
Who are you going after next, sir?
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
Nice car.  Yours?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
Three hundred.
Better believe it.
Let's talk some more first.
And why do you say that?
I think he wanted you to tip him.
By breaking up a company's assets --
Four thousand.
But you want days too.
Three.
I'm sorry.
Why not?
Was someone rude to you?
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
What about dinner?
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
What did you do to him?
I didn't think so.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
You're being ridiculous.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
'Lo.
Couple a hours.
I'm just going to my room.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
I got a dress.
You'll like it fine.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Hi, Barney!
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
May I help you?
Are you looking for something in particular?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Would you like to try it on?
Having a good time, Vivian?
What?
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
... as ... you ... wish...
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
We did it.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
Why is that, do you think?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
The Man in Black?
You've been mostly dead all day.
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
A book?
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Rise and report.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
No --
He's dead. He can't talk.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
Thank you for everything.
You are wonderful!
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
Yes.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Yeah, an hour.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
Oooooooops!
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
What was I saying?
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
You're going to jump on me.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
Maybe it's not true!
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Vaaaat???
But he has long hair!
Not.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Feeling better?
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
Heil you know who!
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
No. At least I don't recall.
Of course not.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
What's your interest?
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
I don't know.
I'm in no mood for trouble!
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
I still feel...
Where?
What thing could we be in together?
Is Mary... in trouble?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
It's been three.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
Sorry.
What?
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Is your time so empty?
You go out... with friends?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
Why don't you go away?
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
No, m'am.
May I see your license?
Oh?
Mary is Lila's sister?
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Norman took a wife?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Yes.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
Gosh, you had me fooled.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
No-
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
Thousands?
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Take me down there.
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
The child!
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
You lie!
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I think so.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
I am right! I know I'm right!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Fine, thanks.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Oh, is that what caused it?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
But I have some friends waiting.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Mia...?
Could we go somewhere?
A place you've never been.
Why am I doing this?
Dysfunctional --
Yes?
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
'Course it does.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Of course not!
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
Open that door, damn you!
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
This is my place and you can't have it.
What's happening?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
I am ahead of you.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
She hasn't actually done anything...
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Well, it was a silly question.
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
Yes, I am.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
What's the matter with him?
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Yes, go on.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Never again, never again...
You think it's that good?
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
We should slow down.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
That's them trying to kill us.
Dean Martin.
Gimmie a butt.
Happy Independence Day.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Birth control's important.
Hey...
That's him alright.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
General Jim Beam, then.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Yeah... great.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
I'm gonna get beside him.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
What... ?  Not you too?
Let's get this thing done.
You get him?
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
How'd we do?
Come again... ?
We're screwed.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
Why the beach?
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
Are you all right?
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Hey, are you awake?
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Shall we try and go around?
I'm sorry.
Here we go again.
What are you telling them?
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Oh!
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
He's my father.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
I was telling the truth.
He might be.  I don't know.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Uh huh.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh....Say something.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
Hello.
Good God.
Promise you won't tell Brad.
"Sweet Transvestite"
"Transylvania"
Want to come again and stay
I think you had better both come inside.
Who's Eddie?
Creature of the night.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
...Aren't you skating?
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Some people are very shy by nature.
Would ya like a glass of water?
D'you really wanna call?
It's okay.
They're all the same.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Don't do that again!
You busted?!
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Kiss my ass.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Nine minutes!
Here -- Three minutes.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Yo' yellow, old man.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
What's ya name again?
What about for food an' stuff?
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
How'd you know?
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky, would you be interested in --
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Goodnight, Rocky.
...What?
How old?
The legs must be goin'.
Here's the card?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
Don't you care what the people will say?
Don't let 'im get you tight.
How am I doin'?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Ya always in a bad mood --
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
It don't matter.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
I got whiskey here.
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
What's this, Roger?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
So altruistic.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
What's with the dip?
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
You tricked me, damn you!
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
Wrong number?
Two bits.
Keep reading...
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Romeo! Romeo!
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
[Within] Juliet!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
What?
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Why, may one ask?
And so did I.
That dreamers often lie.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Pink for flower.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
We kept it...
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
From Interpol?
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
Do I need to repeat myself?
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Whoever hired us.
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Nobody's going to do that!
American.
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
I ride with fat-boy...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
He says this is their block.
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
Lovely, isn't it?
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
What's going on?
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
I never made that claim.
You were behind the door?
What the fuck happened?
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
In a minute.
Time to quit.
Would you stop with that...
That's a good question.
Let's get him out of here...
And now...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
You slept with her!
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
That's right!
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
Here it is.
Do you have everything?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
We've got to go now, then.
Oh Jesus...
Dwayne's dead.
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
Well, I don't know...
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
OK.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
So do I.
How are we going to do all this?
I don't know.
What do you think about all this?
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Sheriff Hogan --
Yeah.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Damn it’s hot in here...
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I’d have found it in a minute.
About what?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
It was going to be a surprise!
What are you saying?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
I'll settle for a third of that.
We're out of here.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
That's great Earl!
Well I don't know --
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
You think he skipped town?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
What'd I say?
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
Where are you going?
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Carter?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
Follow the Rich White Man?
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Slow down, baby.
Is it hot in here?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
Are you okay?
See you in the next world.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Are you serious?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Hello, Benjamin.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Vegas...
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
No you didn't!
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
A little Mu-shu.
I could use a little vacation.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
What's going on?
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
I didn't know which side you were on.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
You talk very fast.
Help me Rhonda.
The license!  You get it?!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
You talk too fast.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
You want more?
Now, that's American music.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Want some?
I'm sorry, Lee.
What are you doing here?
Oh my god. Griffin.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
You don't like it?
Any demands yet?
I'm talking about the girl.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Hmmmm?
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Hello.
I would like one of my people to help.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
I will not have friends in America.
What is he up to now?
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
Yes.
Ahh.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
And in a "V".
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Okay, we'll order out.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
Like her mother.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
I'll have the same.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
What!?
About a minute...?
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
To who?  Are you asking me?
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
But I'm weird.
Lighten up, wahine.
Let's go.
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
I'm really rooting for this one.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
But it's on the water.
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
We'll stay at the Plaza --
It's delicious, trust me.
I do.
Walter.
What was that about up there?
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
You're a basket case.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
What?
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
You don't know who she was, Annie --
Becky?
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Go home for the weekend.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
You know.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Hello.
It's you.
Hello.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
All righ...
It's been about a year and a half.
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
You don't like the one he was now?
Where's your mom?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
No.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
When's the latest time you were out there?
It's Y. O. H.
Eighty dollars.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Somewhere in the middle.
Great.
It's a sign.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
God, she's beautiful.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
You said we could go to New York.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
What if I couldn't get to you?
When I found you?
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
Hi.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
How's Jonah taking it?
Is he there?
It takes time --
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
You're welcome to one.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Got any more ideas?
Take a drink. Calm down!
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
How goes it?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
Why are they singing, Mama?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
What's the matter?
A fighter, huh?
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
When?
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Go on. Spill it.
No ...
Luís! Come down here!
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
Bobby?
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Ride 'em cowboy)
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Yeah.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
What?
Go ahead.
Fuck you.
That's long enough to get out of town.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
It gets me through the day.
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
What are you hiding, Danny?
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
Finland is a country.
So, why'd you want to see me?
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
Can I ask you something?
Danny?
What's this?
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
Can we talk price?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
I'm sorry?
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
Cool it. We got business.
Danny, I'm touched.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Thanks for not judging me.
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
What the hell are you doing here?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Turns out he's connected.
Jimmy?
What's that smell?
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
Really?
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
We're in business.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
But, sir...I...I...
Good luck, John.
So, where are you from?
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
Good luck, Captain.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Captain, what about our deal?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
Uh, Captain...
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
You alright?
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Uh, oh.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Trust me, you're the best.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Goddamn it!
Yes, sir.
I'd like to go, sir.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
How do you do it?
You think he really believed it?
How fast?
How can you, how can you say that?
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Gee, it's easy.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
So, what's your point?
Lloyd is doomed.
Wait a minute.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Ha!
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
I won?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Morning honey.
Which they did.  Let me finish.
You should be.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
I swear to god.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Hello.
Thank-you.  The real world.
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Busy?
So you're monumentally busy?
Actually, I think that I...
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
What are these?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
He does this every year?
Thank-you.
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
You know what?
No, I'm serious.
Won't you see me later?
Me?  Sure I do.
You have to meet Bess.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Okay, this is important...
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
It did?
We'll see.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
You shared it with a dick.
Is this because of your dad?
Did you talk to Corey?
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
How's it going?
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
The guy with the Datsun?
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Thanks Lloyd.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Seriously, Lloyd.
I know.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Oh boy.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Later for you, Luke.
Oskar - my friend Lena.
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
It's not a charade, all this?
Luck.
Should I stay?
Scherner told me something else about you.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
You took my workers.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
How you feeling, all right?
Good.  How's it going?
What are you doing?
Thank you.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
It kind of looks that way.
What others?
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
Better this month than last?
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
He's broken his pattern.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
What if I said goodbye?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
WHAAAATT?
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Where is Sidney's father?
And are the police sure about that?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
I couldn’t believe you didn’t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
I think he's doing Dolly.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Need some help, honey.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
You’re the one who got away.
A twist ending if you will.
We had to have financing.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Not good. How you doin?
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
And it's sexier in the dark.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
Where are you?
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
Yes, goddammit!
I got a surprise for you.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
That was good.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
..it's really about family and tradition...
Do you want to die?
I hate scary movies.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
What was that?
What do you want?
Do you work for her now?
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
What do you mean?
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Who?
Four? There are five.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Hmm.
Detective Kincaid?
I can see nothing's changed.
Yeah?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
What about me?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
Off the record.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Possibly.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Who's this?
It's Sarah.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
You're dead!
WHERE?
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
She can't get both of us.
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Close call.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Jesus, SHIT!
I'm so sorry... please understand.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
So...
I wanna let go. I do...
Who did you call?
NO! Don't believe him.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Who are you trying to reach?
What?
Hello.
I don't think so.
Popcorn.
I have to go now.
Nah, I don't think so...
Dial someone else, okay?
No... please.
...please...
But you're doing so well.
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Evening, ma'am.
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Did you reach my Dad?
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
She staying with you?
That fish smelled strong.
Casey! Casey!
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
What's the plan?
Please. You owe me.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
So where are you?
Hello?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Have a good trip.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
I thought everything was checked out.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Do you believe this shit?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
Already.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
What?  What?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
I don't believe it.
You didn't know.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
You've made a good life for yourself...
You just met me.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
It's too soon for him.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
It's my wife.
Well?
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
You go to movies at least?
No witnesses of any kind?
What?
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?
The fingerprints.
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
And?
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
How do you know all about this?
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
He's preaching.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
No.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Are you absolutely certain?
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
How long have you lived here?
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Perfect example.
But Mose Harper said...
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
You all right, sergeant?
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
He cometh forth like a...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
That's what I said.
I beg your pardon?
You want us to fire a shot if...
What you goin' to do?
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
I think maybe we oughta...
Well, you're a widower now...
No...She's not...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Stay out here.
You figger Scar means to kill us?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Was your niece about their age?
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
They never find that girl.
Don't go takin' that stuff...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
But couldn't you...?
Why else?
Stop that!
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
I miss Tommi so much.
Martin, it's not funny!
Where have you been all day?
What?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
How did you get me out of there?
Do I look like it that much?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Hammer?
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
You did not like the speech?
Ned…I know…I know
Oh
Follow that boat!
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
Wait!  Will you desist!
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
We will all be put in the clink.
How long has it been?
A woman of property?
And your relations?
I have a wonderful new play!
What's the title?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Where is the play?
Is it going well?
But nothing is happening.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
What happened to Sam?
I feel a scene coming on.
Cut round him for now.
We are lost.
Another little problem.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Ethel.
"Good morrow, cousin."
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
Not ready? Where is she?
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
Your Majesty
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
Master Shakespeare
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
Like you, I found him not at home!
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
Can you love a fool?
And that was only my first try.
Oh, Will!
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
I know how to fight!
Will! What--?
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
No…no.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
Yes, sir.
She loves me, Thomas!
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
All right, just a few questions.
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
You're a bad loser.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I'm only asking what you think.
No.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
They know.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Are you recording it?
No. Why should it?
I've never seen any of these men before.
I don't know them.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
Aroused and inflamed.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
Hugo.
He's got a car?
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Hello. Hello.
No.
Will you calm down.
Leave him alone.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Downstairs.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Would you like to talk about it?
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds.
That's what it cost, David.
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
You get the job done.
What guy?
What guy that died?
No.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
It was some guy called Brian.
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
Same as everyone else.
Diseases.
I suppose so.
Both, sir.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
We cannot go into this later.
Thanks a lot.
Why not?
I don't know.
You're late, George.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
What're you doing later?
Your husband?
I know.
Want me to?
Like what?
Then it's not your problem.
Shit.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
No shit.
Yeah...
That you're just like your mother.
You are.
And you need money?
Pardon me?
Yes, Buffums.
You're late, George.
What!
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
Jill's coming with us.
Why not?
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Baby...
George...
Sit down.
-- gee...
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
-- what?
What's wrong?
-- Jesus --
I've got to leave?
Why?
Well then what are you trying to do-
God, there's Lester...
Oh yeah?
I'm busy, man.
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Call me!
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
Yeah.
Honey?
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Egypt.
No, but I think they might.
Never mind. Where've you been?
What business meeting?
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I know, honey.
-- well aren't you --
How come you took your own car?
Well that's something.
Didn't you, baby?
Yes.
What difference does it make?
How?
... well I'm glad you told me.
What? What? What? What? What?
Stop it.
Yes, yes, I did.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
It's an unusual trade.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Sorry, honey, I...
I wanna hear about it.
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Have a drink.
Me!
What about Jackie?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
You really think so?
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.

Awww --
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.

Yes.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
It must be something.
We don't think marriage is important.
-- Yeah, honey...
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
He does?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- He reached up and tore them.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
I'm terribly sorry.
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
You're kidding.
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
-- I'll get in the back --
-- there's not much room --
Are you married?
Do you have something against traveling?
We'll let you know tomorrow.
No of course not.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Yes?
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Yeah.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Red Rum.
Mommy...
Mommy... Mommy...!
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Is Tony one of your animals?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Please...
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
No, we don't mind.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
Hi, babe.
Sure is.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
Did you find anything?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
And you didn't see anything at all?
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
As soon as possible.
Stay away from me,
Stay away...!
Stay away from me.
Stay... stay away!
I'll bring back a doctor.
Have any trouble finding us?
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
Thanks.
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Rattling. Rustling.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Huh?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Was it a prescription?
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
I think I hear it!
How are you doing.
What?
You are so damn sexy.
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
Sure.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
Where did that come from?
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Is this... choir practice?
What is it, Mary?
Hurry, Sister!
Soprano or alto?
What?
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Babies
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
Three years.  A rookie.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
We need experience.
Who are all these people?
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Mary Clarence!
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
What?
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Are you leaving us?
Run!  Take off!
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
St. Anne's?
I see.
Sit down.
And all those like you.
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
And the vow of chastity.
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
I got it.
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
It never solves anything.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
Vince knows you're here.
Then one day they find you.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
It's done?
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
Well?
Right.
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
It's so beautiful...
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
If we could speak alone.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
Certainly not.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
We must be a curious sight to him.
You need to sleep.
Stains of blood.
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Damn... damn... damn...
Very few, if any.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
Listen to what you say....
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
Where are we going?
No, I couldn't...
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
All I saw was their lantern.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
What now?
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
He has proposed to me twice.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Why would you do such a thing?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
What... what are you doing... ?
What is so urgent?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
What was that?
Returning to the Western Woods?
Use caution.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
There was not much blood, was there?
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Thank ye.
I don't reckon.
All right then.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Can I help you?
Did you decide, sir?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Yeah.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
I ain't sure.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
Sure, I guess.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
They let you out?
Did you want to play ball with us?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
They still around, your folks?
How did your mama die?
Who did you kill?
Were they bad people?
Maybe they needed it.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
It was fun, anyhow.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
Huh?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
A blister shore can hurt.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Karl, you up?
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Naw, I ain't.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
What about me?
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
Is he leaving right this minute?
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
What about for you?
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
A photographer ...
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
But they're all the same.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
No, he's not. You are.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
You usually get two.
She probably died.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Like what?
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
So I can get my job back.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Benefits?
And have you mended them?
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Yeah? Who is it?
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
I didn't expect to see you again.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Three nights.
And?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Yeah, it might be.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Well?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Lettuce and tomato?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
That's when he fell.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
You want me to say that.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
For certain, no.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Are these your bags?
Okay, doll.
Wanna see my driver's license?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
You're right, Joe.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
We're not?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
With me?
Nellie told us about it.
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
You don't see any blood?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
You'd better go fix it.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Men?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Jerry - there's another problem.
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Not that, you idiot.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
All right - so what do we do now?
Did you hear that?
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
She sings, too.
We'll take a rain check.
Good night, Sugar.
Oh - Sugar!
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
And you've got cold feet.
I'm not that sick.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
No!
What for?
I always did.
Where did you girls play before?
What's wrong with us?
We could dye our hair.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
We'll adopt some.
I don't like no witnesses.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
We got it second-hand.
Running away?  From what?
Me?
Really?
You don't say?
Brains aren't everything.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Want to switch berths with me?
I wish you'd make sure.
Are you staying at the hotel?
I'm not interested at all.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Yeah.  Real hot.
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
What a beautiful fish.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
You mean - like frigid?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
What else is there for me? 
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Anything this time?
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
Well - ?
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Tomorrow night?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Good evening, sir.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
Refresh my memory.
Christ, Amy.
I don’t think I can go through with this.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
If Ed ever found out....
Where’s Nick sleeping?
Who’s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
I thought you said you were crap.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
I didn’t deserve her back then.
Nothing, nothing.
Hey, Kat.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Bollocks, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Hi. Hey.
What does your gut say?
You quitting?
There’s a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
I love that you’re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
Is this for last night?
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
I’m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
You have had girlfriends?
Like fifteen.
You pawned it.
You want me to let him in?
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
Well, how did you like the class, David?
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?
And so you did your job, right?
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
Yes, sir...
Miss Boatwright --
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
Where did it come from, Mama?
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
What's wrong, Nathan?
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
How's the weather out there?
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Why the fuck not?
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
What?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
I can't believe he's dead.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
Goodnight, honey.
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
You've got a stupid accent too.
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Who are you, kid?
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
Mrph?
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
No... The General is right.
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
How can they do this?
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
What about air strikes?
And Bill?
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
The F word?!
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
It's from your mother.
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
What's going on Terrance?
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Hi Wendy.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Oh yeah...
So...
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
What did you say to me?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
So you were looking for a new challenge.
We don't.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
He certainly is polite.
Are you ready?
You're ready for the real thing?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Dawn.  Come in.
So what's going to happen to you?
So close...
What is it?!
Where's Taylor?
Carlo!
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
What the hell is that?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
Sorry about your loss.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
I hate fuckin' opera.
What's on your mind, Miles?
Buzz Fazeli.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
We ain't married no more.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
He's the guy Buzz.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Son?
How's that?
Who's there!
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Nice set-up.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
132, 154.
Yeah.
I'm a bowler.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
What's your specialty?
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Business.
This is a vicious cycle.
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
I can't tell you, Theo.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
How do you get this thing down?
Can I come with you?
Why did you come back?
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Sez you!
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
Who identified the body?
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
How big is this spacecraft?
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Fifty yards and closing.
Thirty yards.
What was that?
Then why am I here?
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
What for?
Going active.
Can you open that panel?
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
A half a mile long?
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
What is that?
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
Norman!
Yeah, it was awful.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
Don't tell me to calm down!
It's not worth the risk.
You fixed my suit?
But I don't know how --
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
The refridgerator.
That wasn't in there before.
He translated it wrong.
It's for motion sickness.
Parasolutrine?
What's that?
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
What's wrong, Norman?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Do you fear them?
Did you?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
He can't manifest.
You manifested that, Beth.
You're insane.
I promise --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Beth!
Stop it!
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
How's that?
Pussy.
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
What?
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
You sound defensive.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
No.  I didn't say that.
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Norman, where are you?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What do you mean?  She's not here?
Beth left?
It's the squid!  Stop it!
We're never gonna make it.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Gimme a second --
You know how to work this thing?
Well, press something!
How's that working out, by the way?
She told me what you said, Norman.
Do you?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
What report?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
Well, we'll see...
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
What's wrong?  What's happening?
The Kiber Crystal.
You're Starkiller?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
Here come six more... grid two!
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Well, I practice a lot...
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
This isn't going to work.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
Get to the ship!
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
And you?
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
Mobile Infantery rules !
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Johnny, this is Zander.
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Profile's wrong... there.
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
Well, whad'ya know...
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Where are you going ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
What happened to your hair ?
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Report.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
What's that, Diz ?
C'mon...
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Oh, my, what's that ?
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Are your parents currently citizens ?
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
The examination is a normal function.
Disclose the information.
They have repressed the Creator.
Yes.
What does that mean?
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Programming ready?
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Stop competing with me, Decker!
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
<U>Computer off</U>!
Captain, what's the next move?
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
We're losing the pattern...!
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
What should you have known?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
I quit the movie.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
You like my play.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
But why the dalmation?
But, but but but...
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
...such a pleasant sound.
Hi.
About <u>conflict</u>...
<u>How</u>...?
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
What are you doing down there?
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
But it'll stop the movie.
What are you going to do?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
Mornin', Doc...
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
What courthouse?
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
They're holding it for ransom.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Wat...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
Fourteen year old girls.
It's Marty on the Coast -
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
Bobby, don't say anything.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
What else?
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
You guys had better leave us a...
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
What's his name?
No.
You have no right to...
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
...we had a script conference...
This is Joe White.
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
...I can't do it, Wally...
What?
...I...
And you know what...?
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
I know...
Kiss my ass.
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
What's in the case?
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
What?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
I...
I'm very sorry I...
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
Grace...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Why?
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
Hi!
How do they know that, you told them?
She wasn't in...you were al...
Mmm.
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
I've got two days to get this house...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
She coulda done better than him.
We have to lose the window.
Why?
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
I could help with the debate.
I don't want to say goodbye.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
No.  I think it's ugly.
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
...your hating me.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
But you told us to starve.
I made you some cocoa.  See?
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
IS THAT YOU?
Rachel's job is she works.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
I'm fine, ba...
No.
So you're okay.
Find the bird cage?
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
So we'll...radiate some more?
That's necessary, huh?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Which part of no don't you understand?
Planning on getting --
Something's up wi...
Rachel's not half my age.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Called him.  We set an ap...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
What happens next?
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
...in.
Look, you've never liked me...
Did I hear the word...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
Oh, my God.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You put filth in my child's mouth.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
No problem.
Why in the world would she t...
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
I told her I loved her.
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
You know...Stanley...
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Nice to have you here.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
But still, you can't be sure.
Why was he on Death Row?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
Don't even joke about that!
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
I can read it to you.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
I dunno.
What DO you know?
Get the hell outta here!
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
That's good.
You have beautiful skin.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Ni...
...gger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!
No, not really.
OK.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Yeah. But not any more.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
OK. Bye.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Whoopee.
So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Now what?
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
How well do you know this place?
Come on, drink up.
What about Cooper--where is he?
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Where the hell could they have gone!
What's happening at the waterfront?
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
Can I have a glass of water?
Thank you, Admiral.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Yes?
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Give that back to me.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Well, Mister President.
You aren't sure!
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Suppose that were the case?
How much soda, sir.
That about right?
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
Where, sir?
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
And you'd like to see that?
It was a honest mistake, sir.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
How long will it take to receive them all?
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
General, stick to the point, please.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Maximum ECM.
A through H is correct.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Where'd they get you?
What does it look like?
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Shoot, Lothar.
Can't "Ace" help you?
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Are you sure?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Forget it.
At the bottom of mines?
Mn-hm.
Um-hm.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
In Group?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Yup.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
Don't let 'em fight.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
I'd get bored.
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
Good.
Sure.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Y- s-sure it did.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Yeah, man.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Really?
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Hey, man.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
It's okay.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Thanks, man!
Hi.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Yes.
A Porsche.
Deep down. Way down.
Oh, wow.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Hi.
Two-fifty.
Uh-huh.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
See ya later.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Well, w-what happened?
Why? Because I give a shit?
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Jeff, stay there.
Jeff! Come up here!
God, I haven't seen you all day.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Yes, I stand for -
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
This is ridiculous!
Of course.
Come with me.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
No, I don't.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
Mm-hm.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
You're unbelievable.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Ready?
Is that your driver?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
So? What's L.A. like?
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Yeah, come on, play it.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
I'm moving.
Soon.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Oh, How'd she get back?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
So where are you?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Fuck.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Another sex dream?
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Diane?  Diane!
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
Hi, Jack.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
Oh... What are you working on?
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Madonna.
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
Kansas!
Yeah, hold on.
Don't use big bills!
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Your help.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
Well....
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
He thinks it could be made into something.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
So do I.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
You bet.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
What assistant?
Gordon Cole?
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I wouldn't know.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
You're a writer, you said.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Well?
Of course it is.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
It's getting kind of late --
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
I want to talk to you for a minute.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
Keep it.
What's the matter with you?
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
Where are my cigarettes?
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
You heard him.  I'm a star!
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
This room has not been used for a long time.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
That's what I told them.
Whose room was this?
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
How is she?
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Joseph C. Gillis?
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
Got a title?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
How's that about your being my friend?
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
What does it mean?
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Maybe it was just an accident.
This is my favourite place in the city.
Like it?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
We're from different worlds.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
You're not afraid are you?
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Away. From you.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
And now?
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
Hey! Ethan!
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
Oh no, not you again.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
Nurse!
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
Do you have any theories about last night?
Someone's chasing him.
I can't help it if men notice me.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
How'd you do that?
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Your hair looks the same.
No thanks. You go on.
Why is he acting so strangely?
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
I was on Earth...
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Then teach me how.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
You can use the wand.
Goodbye...
What are you talkin' about?
Mr. Roebush?
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
I just can't stand this.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
Peanut butter and jelly.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Do you really know Superman?
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
What kind?
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Is this whitemail?
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Can you do that?
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
No, we're just going down.
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Who is she?
There's no rush.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Where's the light switch?
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
Okay? Goodbye.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
So?
He's the only one who can operate this --
Jimmy, how's the -
Hostages?
Are you okay?
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Oh Clark, no!
It's true. It's true.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Sleep well?
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
"They?"
What else could I do?
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
You'll have to pack quickly.
Mush!  Mush!
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I like trees.
You'll miss the battle of the century!
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Look, they need a machine to fly.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
I've never been in a place like this before.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
You think he'll find us.
What I need this for?
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Mom...
Do you know where you're headed?
Know what?
Big night coming up?
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
You're just jealous.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Besides that.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Damn!  This will get him.
What's the temperature now?
Krypton!
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
See?
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
You're not going to hit me?
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
You got wax in your ears?
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
What're you writing, Lois?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
Who...who...
Superman???
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
How old are you?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Do you like pink?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
Yes...fine.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
But you said...
What happened?
Alison.
I can help you.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
I'll be back around nine.
It just seems...kind of weird.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
What time's he coming home?
They can look forward to that.
Because I have to.
Why did you do that, Billy?
About the Ottos?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
You've talked to Billy?
You heard what Abbott said?
What do you think?
And winter?
Is this mine?
From you?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
It was snowing.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Do you have a room?
Need a hand?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
I'm in a car wash.
Yes.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
That's not news, Zoe.
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Oh God, I'm scared.
We do.
Yes.
You think someone else caused the accident?
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
No.
You are?
I was scared.
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
You remember this?
Of course.
What's that?
Pretty slick, eh?
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Will the police do anything to her?
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
But of course...
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Not being partial, are you?
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Match me, Sidney...
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
Uh huh.
I know Steve.  No.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
I thought he would.
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
I don't think so.
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
That's the third time he's called today.
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
If that's for me, tear it up!
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Did you now?  On which bounce?
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
J.J., if you think -
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
Do you have bandages?
No good.
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Radical.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
You will.
Pain causes it?
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
I know!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
Kyle, don't go!
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
The CPU from the first terminator.
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
On Furtwängler.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
And no elbows on the table!
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
So, what does the Russki want?
So what is it?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Yes, David?
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
You do shorthand and typing?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
What's in those files?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
Why were they going to arrest you?
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
Steve Arnold...
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Von der Null?
Von der Null?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
I have illegitimate children.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Do you know what that is?
Okay, so what is it?
Yes, you remember.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
What?
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
You were in insurance before the war.
Yes, Chuck?
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
What do you think?
Just let me go.
There's so much...
Reese...you got a first name?
What's he like?
That's where we're going.
Let's go.  Time to move out.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
Not possible.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
And so you feel nothing.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
I can help you...
Here, drink some of this...
Admittedly...
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
Excuse me, I need to explain...
There's got to be a flashlight.
Please...
I'll wait.
Never did catch your name.
That's classic.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
Who are "they?"
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
What?
What do you think you're doing?
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
I have to get to the airport...
Yes.
No.
Hey there, Nickie.
Never better.
Tell me you'll call.
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
What are you doing?
The phone's dead.
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
How long will these take?
Get rid of them.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
Guess!
I need the police.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
I've been so lonely.
Hm?
You did?  How is he?
Is everything alright?
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
How concerned should I be?
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
Luke, can I talk to you?
You're not telling us something.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
It's still an electric shock!
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
Like she smelled it too?
Hmm.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Oh God, we can't get out!
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Is there something about the house?
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
Anything but Japanese.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
No.
You should have let me do the talking.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
You broke last time.
Fuck you.
Oh really?  Where you from?
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
Edward Rama?
Who done it, then?
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
Steady on.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Here, are you always this sarky?
Weren't you on a television series?
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
Ashamed.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
What line is he in.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Not that I recall.
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
Where's Big Sur?
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
You sure?
Been away a lot.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
...I guess I've been all wet.
...You are ze fahzer?
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
How ya doin', Ed?
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Uh-huh.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
...Oh, Jesus.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
Dave.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
...Doris--
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
OK, how did you know?
How did you get into the store?
Not guilty, your honor...
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
No thanks.
Taking it seriously.
Coffee, Ed?
...So, uh, who should I--
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Frank.
This hair.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
I don't understand.
'Lo, Ed.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
Someone broke into this room.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
If you don't mind, this could be important.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
What happened to them?
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
What is it?
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
Dr. Frock?
Something tried to get into this room!
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
What do you do?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
We're not supposed to go back there.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Argo!  Hobbes!
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
Oh... my... God!
Jesus, what is this?
Mbwun.
How does it work?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
You're not.  Where is it?
Wounded?
What happened?
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
It's the busy season.
You want to book the flight?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
We're not watching the sea.
He doesn't care.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
Are we talking Emmies?
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
Stay where you are!
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
What's that?
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
Arrah!
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Now what?
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
Well, we're FBI agents.
What do you do?
Special Agent Scully --
You've been back to Dallas?
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
You've got something to show me.
This man's still alive.
Of what?
I'm looking for him.
How's that?
Do I know you?
I think you're full of shit.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
Negotiating with whom?
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
Mulder -- it's me --
I'm on the roof.
No. I haven't.
Had you.
Scully...
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Something's not right...
I wake you?
What are you implying, Scully?
Why are you whispering?
What did you find?
How was it contracted?
He didn't mention a park.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Yeah, well they may this one.
Been where?
I have. I did. It's done.
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
Agent Mulder --
Are we being watched?
What are you doing?
Where's Scully?
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
What is it?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
More concerns than that?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
Did we go sailing?
He hates me.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
Don't bring it home in this.
Sing a song of sixpence.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
Damn him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
...give a kiss to Edward.
There's always a chance they'll confess.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
Agent Novak?
Why'd you bring him here?
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Evil.
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Where the hell are we?
You sure about this?
Oh no... No you don't.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Catherine!
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
That's a secret.
How's the patient.
So?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
Here he is.
We proceed assuming she is.
Right here.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
You were awfully good.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
His own doctor?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
H-E-Z-T...
Oh, that was many years ago.
Seemed like a good idea.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
I'm going back home.
What happened to your hand?
...is there?
That's his headache.
That's what we want to find out.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Can you tell me whose...
My name is Calloway.
Been here long?
See much of him before that?
Him dying like that.
...expense.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
A parrot bit me.
...a week ago.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
...in the morning.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
It wouldn't work.
Be sensible, Martins.
It's a military hotel.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
...excuse me.
...his number.
Heard of Harry Lime?
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
What's that?
Do you expect me to give myself up?
...this way.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
...were of you.
Not yet.
Thank you.
I was told that he did not die at once.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Harry...
Something wrong.
...Mr. Martins?
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Richard - I saw a fin!
Big?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
Hi.
Have you told someone?
We lost our key.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
You think?! Based on what?
They only kill them when they love them?
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
What, do you like it here?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
You're not in school? What do you do?
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Is he a Nazi?
Bigger and better.
Who's Linda?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
And belief follows?
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
I don't know. I just want to try it.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
That's a much easier game.
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
You wouldn't announce it?
Is it okay if I record this?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Those aren't Jews.
I don't think you know what you are.
I always won.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
Don't tell me what I --
What is happening?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Tell it to Hitler.
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
Get out of here....
Shut up. Fuck you....
This will be a different kind of device.
That's all we've got left.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
You remember Miriam....
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
How?
And what did you do?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Where do you think you're going?
It's Friday....
Are you out of your mind?!
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
What do you mean?
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
It can't be true!
Good afternoon.
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
You're right.  You're fired.
You forgot the Hula!
... It's a comfortable place.
What else is there?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
Is he alright?  What happened?
Ten thousand.
Dollars.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
The medics are looking all over for you.
And where did you say you were from?
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Well, what are they?
It's okay.
Why?
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
He doesn't like us.
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
I'm concentrating.
Tea... or whiskey?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
You look adorable.
You jumped in?
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
... No?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Hello?
So have I.  ... Hello?
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
I'm being a pain, huh?
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
What are you doing?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
... And those?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
Please. Will you help me?
There won't be any need for that sir.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
What!?
We do!
Esther!
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Mom! We're eating!
But we're not open on Sundays.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
What are you doing?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Is he in love with you?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
Don't look at it!
The death card - -
What, senorita?
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Well, I'd best be off.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
Why?
You know Charlie How-Come?
Some crazy guy.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Tell me.
Tormented -- ? Why?
Then you found the leopard --
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Wait ——
State hunters?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
I got into a little crap game.
Kiki?
It's a lovely town —- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
When did you get back?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can’t satisfy him?
Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
To get me killed...?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
Do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
So you did talk about it, huh?
What do you suggest?
The word for those things is croissants.
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
By your Austrian?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
How much of a hurry are you in?
On the bed!
You’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Who are you?
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
What’s this place? A hotel of some kind?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
I’ve got work tonight, Jane.
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
I came to feed your fish. I didn’t know...
What if it is?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Must I speak to you in French?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
The £1,000 is on account.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Vous êtes Français?
Problems?
Am I supposed to know him?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
The Hyatt...? What’s that?
What is it?
What are you talking about?
Five to three. You’re early.
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
I’ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
And you ain’t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
Gluck.
Five seconds. Then you die.
Three...
Why did you kill Friedman?
Why did you kill him?
They lost their son. Why?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become ‘have-it- where-it’s-at’... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
What do you think?
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Who do they think I am?!
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
We must sound the retreat!
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
Do as I say!
No...
Yes, but...
W-w-what are you doing?!
Arrest them!
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
Dead you're worthless, darling.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Trial?  What trial??
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
The voice was in your cell?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Thanks be to God.
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
You will??
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
My captains have sworn their support.
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
Well...?  Shall we go?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I... I never lied!
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No.  That was a sword in a field.
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
Yes...
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Is that bad?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
Only God knows the answer to that.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Dorota!
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
Have you seen this?
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
What did you pay him?
Very appropriate.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
Are the Russians here?
Careful! Watch his hand.
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
She looks tired.
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
What for?
You'd have to organise it up here.
You don't want to learn.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
You have to wash them.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
She wants it to come.
What on?
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Mottola.
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
You just worry about your end, kid.
How 'bout Lonnegan?
And?
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
You beat him, kid.
You wanta wait for your share?
Looks like he's sulking.
How ya doin'?
Raise 1,000.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
You done?
What time you get off work here?
You doin' anything tonight?
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
What do you mean?
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
And you were gonna pay me back?
You stayin' in or not?
What happened to your face?
You got nothin' on me.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
She's got me worrying, too.
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
No.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Oh!
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
This is my wedding.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
You've been there?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
He telephoned me today.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Have a shot?
Why, you said...
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
I never had it.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
I'm not telling anyone.
How are you?
I see.  I see.
My wife.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
I have no right to answer that.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
So it's you he was after!
You got types?
Who is she?
By the way, how is your father's side?
Where did you get that?
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
You're a fine watch dog.
Hello... send him up.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
Nick!
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
The suspects!  They won't come.
You're going to drive me crazy!
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
Why are you saying it?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Trying to put it off on her?
I'm sorry...  but...
I just wanted to tell you...
What's in the other direction?
Turn the car around.
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
What's it say?
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
What kind of mine?
And they can't fly around out there forever.
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Get off him.
Stop it!
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
You're out of your mind.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
At-at-at-at-at.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
Take the binoculars.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
It'd make their heads explode.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
You didn't step on any mine.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
My leg is falling asleep.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
This.  Whatever it is.
I don't hear any--
Get up and dig.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's just a mongoose.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
Wes might be right about that.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
What if he's not?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
I don't want to die.
I pick that way.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
What did you say?
Oh, God...
Can't you--
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
What do we do?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
...Wes...?
Can you ride a horse?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
He's not slowing.
Woods.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
What is this?
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
You will.  You'll get it.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
If there's gold.  If!
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Is there anything you do know?
What do you think?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
I think he wants something to drink.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
HUMMMM.....
Hurry up.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
I haven't done anything.
Look, food!
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
What are you doing?
They're watching us now.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
What?
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
Well?
Why did you have LUH come here?
You're in violation.
What?
How do you know?
We've lost SEN!
What have you done, Cut your hand?
That's not it.
She's not there
May I help you?
How's the print coming?
Only once, at Redstone.
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
How long are we going to stay?
You guys seem pretty tight.
How long were you hooked?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Ex-girlfriend?
More metal... sharp edge...
Which one's which?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Right.
Whadaya mean?
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
C4, plastic explosive.
Drop it.
I want to work this.
What the hell was that?
You touch me again and--
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
He is!
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Next week we work the park.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
What's this?
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
No!
What did you talk about?
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
No.
No.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
Yes, Baron.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I want to see-- 
And as for you, waiter--
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
Monescu.
Who?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
The pepper, too?
I like you, Baron.
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
Monescu!
The fourteenth of May.
Two fifty-three, five--
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Lily, you must listen to me.
And you--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
Then you go into the foyer.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
Yes.
Do you know my first name?
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
It's disgraceful!
The same thing.
Beautiful.
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
No--yours, madame.
And you're going to fall for them.
But attractive--
I'm crazy about you!
Then why do you want to go?
You look beautiful.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes, madame?
About what?
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Yes, madame?
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Good luck to you, Rose.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
Rush her.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
None of the stewards have seen her.
She's not on the starboard side either.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
You're precious to me, Rose.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
So, you got a name by the way?
So don't marry him.
It is that simple.
And these were drawn from life?
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
May I cut in, miss?
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
Now it's worse.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
You have to go for help.
Will this work?
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
It's been 84 years...
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Rose, get in the boat!
Anya, I think you're crazy.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
It would be a nice change from you.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Well--shall we go into dinner?
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
Feeling a little better, I see.
Good afternoon--
I hope so.
Isn't she lovely?
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
What did you want a gun for?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Aces full.
How about a little game later?
Could I see you a minute?
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
Yes--are you?
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Where have you been hiding?
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Yes?
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
Don't let's talk about it.
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
We coulda got two third-class!
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Three Jacks.
It's your deal.
How's your mother feeling?
Don't get yourself all worked up--
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
Well, let's hear the poem--
Very good, Mary--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
He's all right.
Not because of Ned.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
That's the truth--every single word!
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
I'll explain later--
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
He said to turn loose of him.
Come on, you...
Forget it.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Don't touch me!
No.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
And I don't even know your full name.
Always?
You feel bad about this?  About me?
What can I get you?
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Oh, all right.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
'Least you admit it.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
That a fact?
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
It's too late -
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
- Instant melt-down.
I'd rather die alone.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Yes -
Do you feel better now?
Paris -
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
That's reassuring.
She married a hockey player.
Where to now, Jimbo?
Interesting presentation.
Have we met?
Boyfriend?
I'll keep that in mind.
No?
Do I have to do everything around here?
... Do you have a gun?
Blood or Dutch?
He's killed closer.
Down?
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
... Yes?
And number two?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
Sorry I'm late -
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
What's your name?
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Why don't you come in for a while?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
I could swear I heard my son call me.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Man, act like this is your home.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
Harry, you know everything.
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
I hope that it's nothing serious.
That smells like fresh coffee.
How is he doing?
You invited me.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
None of your business.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Can I bring some toys?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Woody!  Buzz!
What are you doing over there?
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
According to my nava-computer, the --
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Shhhhhhh!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Something's screwy here.
What?
I dunno.
MOM!!  MOM!!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
That ain't no happy child.
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Laser-envy.
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Reach for the sky!!
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Woody!  Speed up!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
I can manage.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
He made that. In his off hours.
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
He'll murder you when he finds out.
Finn ...
Reprieve.
Surely she is older?
How long has -
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
I'm Melanie.
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
How much?
What is he planning on telling them?
Helena, I'm so sorry --
How much do I pay him?
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Did you get it?
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
How's David?
Helena --
What if every country legalized at the same time?
What are you doing?
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Yes, mom --
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
Arizona.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
We aren't barbarians.
I don't think you're going to do that.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
That's good coke.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
Madrigal's alive.
Somewhere safe.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
She's not at that place you sent her?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
I'm sorry.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
It's a scandal, Franco.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Great.
What?
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
What do you want?
You're too young.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
What? Steady like?
Happy birthday.
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Clear?
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
Exactly.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Director?
Who wrote it?
You don't know, do you?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
God, you're sick.
It was my fucking television.
What?
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
No, I don't think so.
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
It's the great outdoors.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Admit it. We're lost.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
I do not often think of the past.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
Be one with the horse.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There, you see? See?
Is it possible?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
I must have your starship.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?





Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
Sybok, we must find a way...
I don't get it.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Dillinger?
Hi, Alan.
My dinner.
Your old files -- ?
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
How's it going upstairs?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Way to go! We're haulin'!
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
How about over there...that empty memory?
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
There's another beam!
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Flynn... you can't... I
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Yes, MCP.
But-what if I can't...?
Wait...I need that...
What do you think?
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
You bitch.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
Dana, are you listening to me?
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Dad, how come you know the words?
Harry?  HARRY?!
Thanks dear.
Fourteen, Harry.
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
There's another guy, still in the car.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Guy's a spook!
She's still at my house.						*
She's lying.
Now what?
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
What did you tell him?
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Not because you were attracted to him?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
What?
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
I think so.
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Are we going to die?
What is it?
Do you still love me?
As much as you used to?
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
What does she do?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Like one?
Hello?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
That was you?!
You'll call me then?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
What do you want me to do?
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Tell him to look through it.
Thanks a lot.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Ask me them again. One by one.
What kinda music do you like?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
God, Spiderman looks different.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
Who?
What did he do to Arlene?
Yes.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
Yeah.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Where the fuck is that bitch?
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
Clarence?
What?
Clarence sent a letter?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
You're really in love, aren't you?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
What'd'ya tell 'em?
What's this acting class guy's name?
Elliot what?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
What?
He wants to talk ya.
No. Not yet.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Wanna count your money?
I can, but I don't.
I'm really not very -
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
What makes you think I could do that?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I don't believe you.
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
That was very good.
Where'd he come from?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Or a bit player -
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
He knows.
He saw the wire.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
You gotta hold this for me.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Wake up, Cole.
Him?  You saw that man?
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
Hiding?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
You used to call me "James".
"Never cry wolf!"
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
We need gas.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
Excuse me -- what did you say?
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
Uh, that message...me?
But you know what's real now?
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Oh, Jesus.
I think I've heard that before.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
Nothing.
Can I help you, sir?
Where to?
Where in Mexico would you like--
Nope.  Darrell.
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Hey.
How much?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
What you want?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
They look nice.
Jake, what is that?
Maybe I don't want you to.
It's nothing.  Really.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
John?  John where are you going?
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Grace . . . Grace?
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
Let's do it here.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
He was going to take the money.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Someone will find me.
Who the hell are you?
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I have half a mind to--
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Hey!
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
Hungry?
Now what can I do for you?
Talk?  About what?
I'm not rambling.
You meant it.
You love her, but you hate her?
Yeah, well, me too.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
I came for Grace.
I came to kill her.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Not from where I stand.
I asked you a question.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
They're not very imaginative?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
Nooo!
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
I didn't do anything.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
I wasn't doing anything.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
Come on, Jake --
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Great!
Accident.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Hey.
Hundred-fifty.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
No charge.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Got any cold soda?
That's right on my way.
No, I've got it.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You're not from around here, are you?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
Where you coming from?
Where you headed?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
My face tell you all that?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
What about us?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Why?
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
What'd you say to me!
Heineken?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
Morning Grace.
Anybody hurt?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
Help me, Grace, help...
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Wrap it up.
What about Jeb?
I don't think I got the job in New York.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
...I can't remember.
When was the last time I wore pink?
Would you like to try going--
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
You've never been sick?
What's he talking about?
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
I don't know what you're asking?
Are you finished?
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
Yeah?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
I'm going to work out.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
He doesn't look very threatening.
How are you feeling?
Was your family traveling with you?
Twelve years.
How so?
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
I didn't think they'd really do it.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
I thought... you was an angel.
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
Are you really going to kill them?
Free ones?
Yeah. See?
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Hit your finger, huh?
What's all that wood?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
It's only a b-b-b-book...
The... Duck of Death.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
But... if he doesn't miss?
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
Ned's share?
He's... he's dead.
Who killed him?
Then... what?
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Maybe I ain't.
She's passed on, Kid.
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
Better re-load it.
When we gonna double back?
It's gonna get riper yet.
Yeah, he's in there.
He's in there.
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
Yeah, I guess so.
Say, Bill...
You could have it. All of it.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Three ways?
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
He hit you?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
Shit.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
No.
Yeah?
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
Hullo, paw.
No... I meant...
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
We done that stuff.
That ain't what I mean.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
What was the money for?
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
I love you.
I know who he is.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
He's alright.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
Get out.
Don't hurt me.
What fence? Who?
Fenster and Hockney?
No killing?
We'll make it.
What-are they speaking?
How are you, Keaton?
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
What did you say?
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
When does he post bail?
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
No, no, no, no, no.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
You got him wrong.
I don't know about that.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
Then what?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
This is all bullshit.
I knew him. He would never -
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
What did he find?
How good's your intelligence?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
... he wants to testify ...?
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
And what did your team do...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
I did.
Mr. Concannon...?
No further questions.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
They lied.
I do.  Yes.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
She getting good care over there?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
I didn't do too well for you.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
Dr. Gruber ...
You know what happened.
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
What is it?
I had a witness disappear on me.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Are you done?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Hello, I'm calling from...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Maybe I can do something right.
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
Dr. Gruber.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Hi, Mickey ...
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
I have to talk to you.
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
...I have to stand up for her...
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
That's right.
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
... I know.  I went ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
I just saw her.
Thank you.
Mrs. Simmonds.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
One hour.
Dr. Towler...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
Interesting business.
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
How often does this happen?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Ernie's.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Hello?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
You.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
It's a place to live, that's all.
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
The color of your hair...
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Why am I here? What happened?
You don't remember.
Where were you?
Oh... wandering about.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
Oh! Yes. Hello.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Would you like some coffee?
How old?
What are you thinking?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Where are you now?
Take me away from here?
There's a name on the gravestone.
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
My love... because I love you.
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Well?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Could be.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
My... the acrophobia.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Easy, now.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel.
Pop Leibel? Sure.
Here you are.
Out. I've got things to do.
Out!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Just wander.
Yeah.
Jesus.
I said how's it going?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
What did you say?
Don't even start.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Stop it!
I'm calling the police.
Bury her out in the desert.
Her fucking head was caved in.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Wait. Wait a minute.
We can't do this.
So that's what we're doing.
What is your problem?
Where's the candy?
If anything ever happens to me...
Have you thought about what I said?
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
So. When is the wedding.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Yup.
That's right.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
What's goosed?
We need padded chairs.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Oh God. This is insane.
Nobody knows she's here.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He's cracked up.
What?
What?
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Okay fine.
Whatever you say Kojak.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
You're a fucking moron.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
What else have you forgot?
Don't you dare.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Do you love me?
We've got problems here.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
I need your help.
Do you love me?
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
That's sweet.
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
How late?
What about the chairs?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
What?
What kind of stupid question is that?
What are you talking about?
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
What?
No...
But...
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
I don't care for him.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Where did you get that?
Greenpeace.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
You alright?
"You Send Me."
The post-Vegas Man.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
Fucking desert.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Don Amalio!
Enedina and Paco ...
Take me there.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
Yes, it is.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
What will the lady say?
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
That's fifteen by seven?
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
It's very good.
Ramona! Ramona!
Why the bad temper?
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
You see how much you like her?
I don't know, sir.
Miss Viridiana ...
What are you doing here? Get out.
Are they going to work here too?
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
How are you today?
Are your parents alive?
You'll soon find out, you liar!
There's been an accident.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
What's going on, Moncho?
Mother?
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
What about you, Manuel?
Ask the priest, miss.
How do you feel?
In English, please.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
You all right?
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
What did Cox pull him out early for?
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
HEY!!!
I haven't been working on anything.
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
I am beautiful, aren't I?
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
Go to hell.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
What are you doing?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
What does that mean?
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
You know I am.
What's the problem?
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
Can I ask you something?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go —— right now.  Why are you going to do this?
Then shoot him already.
You and me have nothing in common.
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
Aren't you going to watch with me?
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....
...tonight...
...on the way in.
What about it?
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
Izzat the thing...
...The Albanian Campaign...
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
Naa, fuck this, this is nothing.  Oh, Lord -- this just got <u>Big</u>.  I see it -- <u>Big</u> -- Big for <u>you</u> and big for <u>me</u>.
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
Tell me again.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
We'll be back tonight.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
...uh huh...
You're tired, Ronnie.
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.
How's your wife?
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 
Oh, MiGod.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
Well, c'n we get him back home?
We're due at Andrews. 
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
Is there a press conference today?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
China.
Trade Re1ations.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Remember the Maine...
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
We don't need an Act Two.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
You can't have a war without an enemy.
"Back End" ... count on it.
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
The Albanian Campaign.
 A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
No, I'm On Top of it...
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
Don't tune it too good.
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
Public Domain.
I didn't ask for a dog.
It's tough to rhyme.
...as of today, 89% favorable.
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
Why a beret?
A wider option of what?
... That's what you told us to say.
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
It concerns his future!
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Hey the door was open.
Sell?
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
The FAA announcement.
Don't start, alright.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Yeah, right...
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
Where is it?
What if I have a previous engagement?
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
Hi.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
Businessman?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Would you like a closer look?
No Jonathan.
Can I give her a message?
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Haven't we been doing our homework.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Anyone else not coming?
No thank you sir we're fine.
Well?
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
I know that.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
I started seeing things.
Who's idea was it?
These are good.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
Are you humoring me?
She said, "You know."  That I know.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Who?
No.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
I didn't sleep with him.
He was so pissed.
We were suite mates.
You should have heard her play.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
You are?
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Telling you...
Sit down here.
Something was there.  You saw it.
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Oh God...you knew.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
It's today?
Claire?
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Of what?
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
Norman, you have to look at this!
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Claire?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
You didn't?
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
Our house.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
...like it never even happened...
I don't need a shrink.
Are you lonely?
What are you doing out here?
This is the Feur thing?
Who did?
How did you--
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
Do I have everything?
What?
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
I take it your not mad at me.
It's too rough.
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Your wife...
Claire, please don't...
Stop...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
I don't believe you.
Mmmuh...
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
Don't tell Rowan about this.
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
Eighty million doll --- ?
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
Michael...  Do what you can.
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
Made it...?
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
There is no one here but the dead.
Do not tell me that!
No!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
Harder...
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
Harder...
What else did you see- Michael...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
You did that, didn't you...?
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
When aid you get home last night...?
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
I can't.
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Which do you think is her best shot...
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
I don't know
What didn't you like about her?
Tell me how it happened...
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
What is it?
Yes...
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
Well, what do you think?
What happened?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Her husband left her
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
ANGEL...
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
So far away? In Xenia?
Hurry.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
I thought I loved her.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
Well?
God, you are so hot.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
You're way ahead of me again?
The lesson being?
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
You do know how to drive?
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Well?
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
If you could just sign right there.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
He was my Grandfather, too.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
In what sense?
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I don't get the distinction.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Well? What do you think of her?
I mean my father.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
I see.
You think you're working with chimps here?
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
But who would run the store?
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
You do like girls, don't you?
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
I do?
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
I told you you could do it.
You were the new and improved you.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
What are you doing?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
I don't know what to say...
I've got that two o'clock in town.
You saw the news today?
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
That bothers you?
No.
Yes.
Why?
Are you crazy, Ray?
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
What did you do then?
Ms. Toller?
This wasn't my idea.
It's those rocks, up there.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
I say something funny?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Get off my property.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
So, where you off to now?
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
How much?
Hello?
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
There's nothing for them to get.
I just want my life back...
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Who is it?
Where is she?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
You mean this thing?
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
But I..
What's wrong?
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
No.
Didn't you see her this morning?
J. S. Bach.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
What was all that back there?
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Jim, are you all right?
Well... that, too.
What is that?
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
There's only seventy-eight.
Are those just button buttons or...?
My hat is off to you, sir.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
A new friend?
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
She's perfectly safe.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
French?
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
The first.
Dr. Pemberton?
Well?
When are they coming?
Hey...!
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
You are very important, Willow.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Because it's true.
Sorsha.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Fresh goat's milk.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Did she ask about me?
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
She's a bird, Willow.
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
How am I gonna do that?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
What's the magician's weapon?
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
Patience, Willow.
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
I'm not going in there.
We gotta follow them.
This is not going well.
Obviously.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Milking?
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Hey, Sam...
What are you going to do?
How reliable is this kid?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
You have no right to keep us here.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
But why would they murder...
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Who are they?
Buttons are Hochmut.
The... bullets?
We had some lemonade and he left.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
Sure.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
It's me.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
What's so funny?
I am not a child.
Get back in there.
No --
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Our echo.
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
That's right.  What's she doing?
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Oil can.....Oil can....
Where do you want to be oiled first?
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
I'll be home in time for supper!
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Because I'm still scared!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
...along.
Yes -- there --
No -- No -- No -- No!
Yeah.
Dorothy next!
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
Not even a rhinoceros?
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Where do we go now?
... about Dorothy.
...junk!
No, sir!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Oh, dear, dear.
...to Dorothy!
What about us?
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
You new?
What happened to Len Tashka?
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
They won’t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
The plutonium is missing.  They’ve taken the core!
What the hell are you talking about?
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
The King pipeline.
Do you know what you’re doing?
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
The report King bought. It’s a manual. Renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
They’re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can’t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
She’ll get over it.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
James...
I don’t want to be safe!
What the hell are you doing here?
...what?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
Where’s the sub going?!
The Maiden’s Tower.
Warm.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
Any word from him?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
A whore fucking.
The bearer of bad news.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
Jon, where are we?
Jon --
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
Who?
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
I¹m not.
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
This'd better not be what I think it is.
What the hell -- ?
They're practically on us . . .
What?
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
So do I.  So do you.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Where's Laurie?
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
I can fix it.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
What about you?
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
What is this place?
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
What do I get out of it?
Not bad for a gimp.
Is that all?
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
How will you fix it?
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Whatchu doing here?
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
What game is that?
Like what?
I was invited. What's your story?
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
What's that?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
Where'd the damn truck go?!
You okay?
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
The Peace conference...
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
I think I'll hang on to these.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Sorry, "dude".
What's so damn funny?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
That was for Anders.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
If necessary.
You should always work with a spotter.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
He takes himself seriously.
What am I doing here?
Who?
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
How?
You designed this yourself?
He helped you?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Frederick Frankenstein?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Yes, sir.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
What?
Still happy you married me?
Love me oodles and oodles?
Miss me?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Promise??
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Are you suggesting I call him master???
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
There seem to be quite a few books.
Well... we'll see.
How long will this whole thing take?
I didn't do that.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Nineteen, sir.
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
Frederick Frankenstein?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Are these your bags?
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
I thought you wanted to.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Did you hear that strange music??
How?
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
Hmm!
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
You're sure you know what you're doing?
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
Cold!  Cold and dead!
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
Yes.
All right -- where is she?
Thanks...for all your help.
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Hello there.
How's everything?
MMMmmmmmm.
Extremely well.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Are you busy?
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Inga, wake up!
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Look, Doctor!
Oh, doctor!
Right here?
It wasn't me.
It looks that way.
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
Did you do it?
Just passing through the night.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Are you ready for me?
Look how far we've come.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Drink!
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Stuart?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
